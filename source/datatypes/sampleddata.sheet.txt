 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData
  Type = Type
  Short Label = A series of measurements taken by a device
  Definition = A series of measurements taken by a device, with upper and lower limits. There may be more than one dimension in the data
  Requirements = There is a need for a concise way to handle the data produced by devices that sample a physical state at a high frequency
  Comments = The data is not interpretable without at least origin, period, and dimensions, but these are optional to allow a separation between the template of measurement and the actual measurement, such as between DeviceCapabilities and DeviceLog.  When providing a summary view (for example with Observation.value[x]) SampledData should be represented with a brief display text such as \"Sampled Data\".
  v2 Mapping = N/A (but see section 7.14 in v2.7)
  RIM Mapping = SLIST + GLIST

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData.origin
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = SimpleQuantity
  Short Label = Zero value and units
  Definition = The base quantity that a measured value of zero represents. In addition, this provides the units of the entire measurement series
  RIM Mapping = SLIST.origin

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData.period
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = decimal
  Short Label = Number of milliseconds between samples
  Definition = The length of time between sampling times, measured in milliseconds
  Comments = This is usually a whole number
  RIM Mapping = GLIST.increment

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData.factor
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = decimal
  Short Label = Multiply data by this before adding to origin
  Definition = A correction factor that is applied to the sampled data points before they are added to the origin
  RIM Mapping = SLIST.factor
  Default Value = 1

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData.lowerLimit
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = decimal
  Short Label = Lower limit of detection
  Definition = The lower limit of detection of the measured points. This is needed if any of the data points have the value \"L\" (lower than detection limit)
  RIM Mapping = N/A (use SLIST.digits.nullFlavor)

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData.upperLimit
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = decimal
  Short Label = Upper limit of detection
  Definition = The upper limit of detection of the measured points. This is needed if any of the data points have the value \"U\" (higher than detection limit)
  RIM Mapping = N/A (use SLIST.digits.nullFlavor)

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData.dimensions
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = positiveInt
  Short Label = Number of sample points at each time point
  Definition = The number of sample points at each time point. If this value is greater than one, then the dimensions will be interlaced - all the sample points for a point in time will be recorded at once
  Comments = If there is more than one dimension, the code for the type of data will define the meaning of the dimensions (typically ECG data)
  RIM Mapping = N/A (fixed to 1)

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = SampledData.data
  Card. = 1..1
  Regex = ((-{0,1}\\d*\\.{0,1}\\d+)|[EUL])( ((-{0,1}\\d*\\.{0,1}\\d+)|[EUL]))*
  Type = string
  Short Label = Decimal values with spaces, or \"E\" | \"U\" | \"L\"
  Definition = A series of data points which are decimal values separated by a single space (character u20). The special values \"E\" (error), \"L\" (below detection limit) and \"U\" (above detection limit) can also be used in place of a decimal value
  RIM Mapping = SLIST.digits
