<h2>Resource References</h2>

<p>
Many of the defined elements in a resource are references to other resources. Using these
references, the resources combine to build a web of information about healthcare. 
</p>
<p>
Resources contain two types of references:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Internal "contained" references</b> - references to other resources packaged inside the source resource</li>
 <li><b>External references</b> - references from resources found elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>
References are always defined and represented in one particular direction - from one resource (source) to another (target).
References are provided as a URL, which may either be absolute or relative. Resolving the references is discussed below.
</p>
<p>
The corresponding reverse relationship from the target to the source exists in a logical sense, but is 
not represented explicitly in the resource. For external references, navigating these reverse relationships requires some 
external infrastructure to track the relationship between resources (the <a href="http.html">REST API</a> provides one such 
infrastructure by providing the ability to <a href="http.html#search">search</a> the reverse relationship by naming 
search parameters for the references).
</p>
<p>
Because resources are processed independently, relationships are not considered to be transitive. 
For example, if a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource references a particular 
<a href="patient.html">Patient</a> as its subject, and it links to a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>
resource as its cause, there is no automatic rule or implication that the procedure 
has the same patient for its subject. Instead, the subject of the procedure must be established 
directly in the procedure itself. Another way to state this is that the context of the subject
is not "inherited", nor does it "conduct" along the relationship to procedure. 
The only exception to this in the case of contained resources (see below). Note that in
practice, the relationships do need to describe a logical and coherent record, and in the
case of the Condition and Procedure described here, they would usually be required to have
the same patient for their subjects.
</p>

<p>
In a resource, references are represented with a reference and a text description. 
The <i>reference</i> is the key element - resources are identified and addressed by their URL.
The actual reference looks like this:
</p>

[%dt Reference%]

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <i>reference</i> element contains a url that is either 
   <ul>
     <li>an absolute URL</li>
     <li>a relative URL, which is relative to the <a href="http.html#root">Service Base URL</a>, or, in a bundle, <a href="#atom-refs">the bundle context</a></li>
     <li>an internal fragment reference (see "Contained Resources" below)</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Using absolute URLs provides a stable scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a 
   flexible approach suitable for use when trading across closed ecosystem boundaries. (see <a href="implementation.html#identity">implementation issues for further discussion</a>)</li>
 <li>Absolute URLs do not need to point to a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>, though this is the preferred approach.  
   Whether or not the reference is to a FHIR RESTful server, the reference SHALL point to a Resource as defined by this specification</li>
 <li>URLs are always considered to be case-sensitive</li>
 <li>The <i>display</i>, if populated, does generally not have identical content to the Resource.text of the referenced resource.  The purpose is to 
   identify what's being referenced, not to more fully describe it</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p>A relative reference to the <a href="patient.html">patient</a> "034AB16" in an element named "context" on a FHIR RESTful server:</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;context&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Patient/034AB16" /&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;
</pre>
<p>An absolute reference to a <a href="profile.html">resource profile</a> in an element named "profile":</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;profile&gt;
    &lt;reference value="http://fhir.hl7.org/svc/Profile/c8973a22-2b5b-4e76-9c66-00639c99e61b" /&gt;
  &lt;/profile&gt;
</pre>
<p><i>Note that HL7 has not yet actually created a profile registry, nor decided on a URL for it</i>.</p>
<p>
A short display text that provides a human-readable identification of the resource may be provided:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;custodian&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Organization/123" /&gt;
    &lt;display value="HL7, Inc" /&gt;
  &lt;/custodian&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This text can be used by a system that is unable to resolve the reference to an actual resource.
</p>
</div>

<a name="contained"> </a>
<h3>Contained Resources</h3>
<p>
In some circumstances, the content referred to in the resource reference does not have an independent 
existence apart from the resource that contains it - it cannot be identified independently, and nor 
can it have its own independent transaction scope. Typically, such circumstances arise where the resource
is being assembled by a secondary user of the source data, such as a middleware engine. If the data available
when the resource is constructed does not include record keys or absolute identification information, then
a properly identified resource cannot be assembled, and even if an arbitrary identification was associated
with it, the resource could never be the subject of a transaction outside the context of the resource that
refers to it.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a situation where an interface engine is creating a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a>
record on a patient from an HL7 v2 message, and the only information about the primary surgeon is her 
first name and lastname (REL-7.2 &amp; RES-7.3). In the absence of a controlled practitioner directory, 
this is not enough information to create an identified <a href="practitioner.html">Practitioner</a> 
resource - more than one practitioner might have the same name. 
</p>
<p>
In these circumstances, the resource is placed directly in line in the resource. <b>This SHOULD NOT be 
done when the content can be identified properly, as once the identification is lost, it is extremely difficult 
(and context dependent) to restore it again.</b>
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
An example of a contained resource:
</p>
<pre class="xml"> <!-- Can't fragment test this - too incomplete -->
 &lt;Composition xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir"&gt;
  &lt;extension&gt;...&lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;...&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;contained&gt;
    &lt;Organization&gt;
      &lt;id value=&quot;org1&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;!-- whatever information is available --&gt;
    &lt;/Organization&gt;
  &lt;/contained&gt;
  &lt;information&gt;
    &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
    &lt;custodian&gt;
      &lt;reference value="#org1" /&gt;
    &lt;/custodian&gt;
    &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
  &lt;information&gt;
 &lt;/Composition&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The same example in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json"> 
{ "resourceType" : "Composition",
  "extension" : { ... },
  "text" : { .. },
  "contained: [
    {
      "resourceType" : "Organization",
      "id" : "org1",
      .. whatever information is available ...
	}  ]
  "information: {
    ... other attributes ...
    "custodian" : {
      "reference" : "#org1"
	}
    ... other attributes ...
  }
}
</pre>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="design-note">
<p>
Design Note: Contained resources are still a reference rather than being inlined directly 
into the element that is the reference (e.g. "custodian" above) to ensure that a
single approach to resolving resource references can be used. Though direct containment
would seem simpler, it would still be necessary to support internal references where the 
same contained resource is referenced more than once. In the end, all that it would achieve
is creating additional options in the syntax. For users using XPath to process the resource,
the following XPath fragment resolves the internal reference: 
</p>
<pre>
ancestor::f:*[not(parent::f:*)]/f:contained/*[@id=substring-after(<b>current()</b>/f:reference/@value, '#')]
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Some notes about use and interpretation of contained resources:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The "contained" element SHALL NOT have extensions on it (though contained resources can still contain extensions)</li>
  <li>Contained resources share the same internal id resolution space as the parent resource (for id attributes, see below)</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHALL NOT contain additional contained resources</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHOULD not contain any narrative</li>
  <li>Resources that are contained inline also "inherit" context from their parent resource. For instance, if 
    the parent resource contains a "subject", and the contained resource also has a subject element defined, 
    but does not specify any subject, a processing application may infer that the subject is the same. Note,
    however, that such inferences are specific to a particular circumstance. There is no rule, for instance, 
	that the meaning of the "subject" element is the same in both parent and contained resources</li>
  <li>A contained resources can only be included in another resource if something in the resource actually refers to it:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resolving references to Resources in Bundles</h3>
<p>
When processing bundles, applications should always search the resources in the 
bundle first when a <a href="#Resource">resource reference</a> is encountered. 
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;institution&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Organization/23" /&gt;
  &lt;/institution&gt;
  &lt;institution&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Organization/ex/_history/2" /&gt;
  &lt;/institution&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
then the application should look for any entry in the bundle where either the 
entry.id or the entry.link[self] matches the reference URL exactly:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
   .. bundle ..
  &lt;item>
    &lt;Organization xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
       &lt;id value="23"/&gt;
       &lt;!-- Content for the resource --&gt;
    &lt;/Organization>
  &lt;item>

  &lt;item>
    &lt;Organization xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir">
      &lt;id value="ex"/&gt;
      &lt;meta&gt;
        &lt;versionId value="2"/&gt;
      &lt;/meta&gt;
      &lt;!-- Content for the resource --&gt;
    &lt;/Organization>
  &lt;item>
    ... bundle ...
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In the second case, the match is based on a specific version of the 
resource. If the resource reference cannot be resolved
in the bundle, the application SHOULD be able to retrieve the resource by 
following the provided URL directly. If it can't, it will have to use some 
other implementation-specific method for resolving how to find the resource.
</p>
<p>
If the resource reference is a absolute URL, the same basic principle 
applies: attempt to resolve the reference in the bundle first, and then
look outside. However, before this can be done, the absolute URL must 
be compared to the stated based URL, in <a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.base">Bundle.base</a>;
if these do not match, the resource is not in the bundle. <i>todo-bundle: how to mix content?</i>
</p>
<!--
<p>
Note that the application SHOULD not assume that the base
service root is actually resolvable. In some circumstances, it will. 
If the bundle has just been received from a server as a result of 
a search or a history operation, the service root URL SHOULD match
the URL that the client used (it is allowed not to in order to 
cater for proxies of various kinds). However in other 
circumstances, where the bundle itself has been exchanged onwards
from the point of origin, and/or stored as an entity in its own 
right (e.g. a <a href="documents.html">clinical document</a>) the 
service root URL is merely a logical construct that holds within the 
bundle when resolving resources, and will have no meaning outside 
the bundle. 
</p>
-->

<p>
Note that some elements have the type "<a href="datatypes.html#uri">uri</a>" instead of "Reference". 
URIs may point to either resources, elements inside a resource by their "id" property, or (most often) 
some other content that is not a resource. The Reference type is only used to refer to resources 
directly, by their logical id.
</p>


<!--
<li>
<a name="Ids"> </a>
FHIR resources make use of id attributes as targets for <a href="references.html#id">internal references with resources</a>. 
These id attributes are unique and resolved within the context of a single resource. When resources are 
combined into a bundle, different resources may contain duplicate id attributes. Thus it is important to limit
the scope of resolution of an id attribute to the resource in which the <i>id</i> attribute is declared.
</li>
