      <p><b>DAF Substance-Reactant for Intolerance</b></p>
      <hr/>
      <p>A substance or other type of agent (e.g., sunshine) that may be associated 
       with an intolerance reaction event or a propensity to such an event. These 
       concepts are expected to be at a more general level of abstraction (ingredients 
       versus more specific formulations). This value set is quite general and includes 
       concepts that may never cause an adverse event, particularly the included SNOMED 
       CT concepts. The code system-specific value sets in this grouping value set are 
       intended to provide broad coverage of all kinds of agents, but the expectation 
       for use is that the chosen concept identifier for a substance should be appropriately 
       specific and drawn from the available code systems in the following priority order: 
       NDFRT, then RXNORM, then UNII, then SNOMED CT. This overarching grouping value 
       set is intended to support identification of drug classes, individual medication 
       ingredients, foods, general substances and environmental entities.
