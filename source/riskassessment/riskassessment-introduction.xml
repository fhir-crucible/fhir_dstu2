<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This resource captures predicted outcomes for a patient or population on the basis of source information.  Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A prognosis statement for a particular condition</li>
  <li>Risk of health outcome (heart attack, particular type of cancer) on the basis of lifestyle factors and/or family history</li>
  <li>List of potential health risks based on a patient's genetic analysis</li>
  <li>A prediction of outbreak infection rates within a geography based on immunization rates</li>
</ul>
<p>
This resource can be used to represent the results of formal scoring/decision support tools that evaluate
risk.  It can also be used to capture a practitioner's subjective assessment of the patient's risk based
on existing knowledge and previous experience.
</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Risk assessments are a specialized type of observation.  We use a specialized resource to provide a simpler mechanism to capture of a series of risks and to associate those risks with time-ranges, probabilities, etc.  All risk assertions are captured at one time based on a single set of source inputs.  Capture of a single risk MAY be done using the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> class, particularly in circumstances where it's treated as a generic observation, but for consistency, all risk assessments and prognosis SHOULD be captured using <b>RiskAssessment</b>.
</p>
<p>
Risk assessments may be based on a variety of factors, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic demographic information from the <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> or <a href="group.html">Group</a> resources</li>
<li>Various <a href="observation.html">Observations</a> including vital signs, lab information, assessments, genetic information, etc.</li>
<li><a href="familymemberhistory.html">FamilyMemberHistory</a></li>
<li>Current, past and proposed therapies <a href="immunization.html">Immunization</a>, <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>, <a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because so many resources can potentially be used, no limit is placed on what resources can be sent in <code>RiskAssessment.basis</code>.  However, some resources would be nonsensical for this use (e.g. <a href="messageheader.html">MessageHeader</a>).

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Risk Assessments can be determined manually by health-care providers based on their professional expertise, by using an algorithmic scoring system or through a combination.  Risk assessments can also be computed by decision support systems.  <a href="operationdefinition.html">OperationDefinitions</a> may be defined by servers to generate risk assessments based on particular combinations of source resources or other inputs.
