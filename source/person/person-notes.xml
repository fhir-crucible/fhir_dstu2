  <h2>De-normalized Data</h2>
  <p>
    Most of the properties of the Person resource are replicated within the other resources that they
    are shared with. This is intentional and highlights that the "disconnectedness" of the resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not many systems actually implement a shared Person record, and as such the values DO become out of
    sync with each other. The inclusion of this resource does permit a capability for systems to identify
    other instances of this actual person's data via a centralized registry that can assist in keeping things
    up to date.

  <h2>
    Person and Linking
  </h2>
  <p>
  The <i>link</i> element is used to related resources under a common person record. 
  This element supports two primary scenarios where other resources refer to the same person resource.
  </p>

  <h2>
  Cross-Domain Patient Directory
  </h2>
  <p>
    
    In a data sharing network, finding the location of patient records across different systems is a 
    necessary pre-requisite for accessing external patient data. Using the <i>link</i> element, systems associate
    patient resources from different organizations. The assuranceLevel associated with the <i>link</i> provides
    a way for a system to qualify its confidence in the asserted <i>link</i>. For example, a relationship from
    the person to a patient using a probabilistic matching algorithm may be represented using a <i>link</i> with
    an assurance level of level1, while a relationship established using a government-issued photo ID may
    be created with an assurance level of level3.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Cross-Domain Provider Directory
  </h2>
  <p>
    Similarly, providers working in multiple healthcare service settings may be linked across different 
    organizations using the <i>link</i> element. The various practitioner resources can be related using a common 
    person resource with a <i>link</i> for each of the practitioner resources located in other organizations.
  </p>


  <h2>
Original PA Notes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Person resource exists to enable Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless of their role. 
The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role such as 
SubjectofCare, Practitioner and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and so Person is kept lean. 
Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the Person himself. 
Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Practitioner), 
and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare)</li>
</ul>
