<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DAF Encounter profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for encounters experienced by a Patient</li>
	<li>Query for all encounters during a time period</li>
	<li>Query for all encounters based on class(e.g outpatient,inpatient) and specific encounter type(e.g diabetes,cancer)</li>
	<li>Query for encounters based on location</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Implementation Guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	<p><b>Specifying Patients as part of the Encounter Queries:</b> DAF Encounter profile supports the querying the Encounters for a particular patient. In order to achieve this in implementation, it is recommended to use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the encounters relevant to the patient. While other parameters such as  Patient.name, Patient.given could be used for the query, it could lead to incorrect Patient matching and/or inefficient queries when systems are not tuned. </p>
	
	<p><b>Patient Matching:</b> Patient Matching rules and criteria have to be evaluated by the implementing organization and have to comply with local policies and regulations. Query Requestors will have to deal with result sets that can return zero,one or more AllergyIntolerance Resources in response to a query.</p>
	
	
</ul>
