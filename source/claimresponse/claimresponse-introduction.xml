<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The ClaimResponse resource provides application level error or application level adjudication results
 which are the result of processing a submitted disciplineClaim which is the functional corollary of 
 a Claim, Pre-Determination or a Pre-Authorization.
 </p>
 <p>
 This is the adjudicated response to a Claim, Pre-determination or Pre-Authorization. The strength 
 of the payment aspect of the response is matching to the strength of the original request. For a 
 Claim the adjudication indicates payment which is intended to be made, for Pre-Authorization and 
 Pre-Determination no payment will actually be made however funds may be reserved to settle a claim 
 submitted later. Only an actual claim may be expected to result in actual payment.
 </p>
