=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = Element
  English = All FHIR elements must have a @value or children
  XPath = @value|f:*|h:div
  Severity = error

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Element
  Inv. = 1
  Short Label = Base for all elements
  Definition = Base definition for all elements in a resource
  RIM Mapping = n/a

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Element.@id
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = id
  Short Label = xml:id (or equivalent in JSON)
  Definition = unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references)
  RIM Mapping = n/a

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Element.extension
  Card. = 0..*
  Aliases = extensions, user content
  Type = Extension
  Short Label = Additional Content defined by implementations
  Definition = May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension
  Comments = There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone
