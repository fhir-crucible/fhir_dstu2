<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->
A Goal in health care services delivery is an expressed desired health state to be achieved by a subject of care (or family/group) 
over a period or at a specific point of time.  This desired target health state may be achieved as a result of health care 
intervention(s) or resulting from natural recovery over time.  For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A goal of a plan for a condition such as a diabetes might specify desired outcome(s) (e.g. HgbA1c level =&lt;5.6% in 3 months) as a 
result of interventions such as medication therapy, nutritional management and/or increase physical activity.  
</li>
<li>
A goal of a procedure might be to meet the intended objective of the procedure (e.g. wet-dry-dressing changes twice a day; goal: 
wound healed completely in 2 weeks) or to prevent an unintended complication (e.g. repositioning a patient every two hours:
goal to maintain skin integrity) 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Goals may address the prevention of illness, cure or mitigation of a condition, prolongation of life, or mitigation of pain and discomfort.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Goals are typically established in the context of a <a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a>.  However, goals may also be directly
referenced by request-type resources (e.g. <a href="medicationprescription.html">MedicationPrescription</a> or <a href="referralrequest.html">ReferralRequest</a>)
by using an extension.
</p>
<p>
Goals are often evaluated using <a href="observation.html">Observations</a>.
