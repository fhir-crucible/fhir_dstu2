The FHIR specification defines a set of data types that are used for the 
resource elements. There are two categories of data type: simple / primitive types, which are single elements, and complex types, which are re-usable clusters of elements.
This page describes the data types. See also the <a href="datatypes-examples.html">Examples</a>, <a href="datatypes-definitions.html">Detailed Descriptions</a> and 
<a href="datatypes-mappings.html">Mappings</a>.

<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>For all the types, the XML and JSON representations are the same except for different escaping in XML and JSON</li>
 <li>Boolean values can also be represented using coded values (such as <a href="v2/0136/index.html">HL7 v2 2 Table 0136</a>). See <a href="observation.html#valuex">Observation</a> for one such use</li>
 <li>The regexes may allow a broader set of values than are actually valid (e.g. leap years) so additional validation is needed</li>
 <li>The precision of the decimal value has signficance:<a name="precision"> </a>
    <ul> 
      <li>e.g 0.010 is regarded as different to 0.01, and the original precision should be preserved</li>
      <li>Implementations SHALL handle decimal values in ways that preserve and respect the precision of the value as represented for presentation purposes</li>
      <li>Implementations are not required to perform calculations with these numbers differently, though they may choose to do so (i.e. preserve significance)</li>
      <li>See implementation comments for <a href="xml.html#schema-gen">XML</a>, <a href="json.html#decimal">JSON</a> and <a href="rdf.html#decimal">RDF</a></li> 
      <li>In object code, implementations that might meet this constraint are GMP implementations or equivalents to Java BigDecimal that implement arbitrary precision, or a combination of a (64 bit) floating point value with a precision field</li> 
      <li>Note that there is no absolute limit to the magnitude of the value, though large and/or highly precise values are extremely rare in medicine. One element where highly precise decimals may be encountered is the <a href="location.html">Location</a> coordinates</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
</ul>


<h3>XML and JSON representations</h3>

<p>
All elements using these primitive types have some combination of value as described above, an internal identity (e.g. xml:id), and extensions. 
The value is represented in XML as an attribute named "value":
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;count value="2"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
 and as the value of the property in JSON:
</p>
<pre>
  "count" : 2
</pre>
<p>
For additional details, including how the internal identity and extensions are represented, see the <a href="xml.html">XML</a> and <a href="json.html">JSON</a> formats. 
When the value is missing, it is not represented in the instance; the XML value attribute or the JSON property are not represented at all. This means that 
in xml, attributes are never present with a length of 0 (value=""), and properties are never a 0 length string or null in JSON ("name" : "" it not valid). 
(note: there is one specific <a href="json.html#null">use of the null</a> in the JSON represesntation).
</p>
<p>
According to XML schema, leading and trailing whitespace in the value attribute is ignored for the types 
boolean, integer, decimal, base64Binary, instant, uri, date, dateTime, oid, and uri. Note that this means that the 
schema aware XML libraries give different attribute values to non schema aware libraries when reading the 
XML instances. For this reason, the value attribute for these types SHOULD not have leading and trailing spaces.
String values should only have leading and trailing spaces if they are part of the content of the value. 
In JSON, whitespace in string values is always significant. Primitive types other than string SHALL NOT have leading or trailing whitespace.
</p>

<h3>Simple Restrictions</h3>
<p>
In addition to the base primitive types, a few additional primitive types are defined as restrictions on one of the other primitive types.

<p>
Some additional notes about the <code>id</code> datatype:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Ids are case sensitive. UUIDs SHALL be sent using lowercase letters</li>
 <li>The ID type includes identifiers consistent with <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38610">ISO 18232</a>, but also includes other identifier formats as well, and is not case insensitive like ISO 18232.</li>
 <li>In a typical FHIR URL, like http://example.com/fhir/Patient/<span style="color: navy">1234</span>, the last part "1234" (highlighted in navy) is the part that is an id datatype</li>
 <li>A full UUID is a <code>uri</code>, not an <code>id</code>. UUIDs in URIs SHALL also be represented in lowercase (urn:uuid:59bf0ef4-e89c-4628-9b51-12ae3fdbe22b), which SHALL be in lowercase</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some additional notes about the <code>markdown</code> datatype:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Systems are not required to have markdown support, and there is considerable variation in markdown syntax, 
   so the content of the string should be readable without markdown processing, per merkdown philosophy</li>
 <li>The preferred markdown syntax is described at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</a>
   (see tests here: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/MarkdownTest_1.0.zip">http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/MarkdownTest_1.0.zip</a>)</li>

<h2>Complex Types</h2>

<p>
These types are represented as XML Elements with child elements with the name of the defined elements of the type. The name of the element is defined where the type is used. 
Any of the XML elements may have an <a href="references.html#id">id attribute</a>. In JSON, the data type is represented by an object with properties named the same as the
XML elements. The JSON representation is almost exactly the same, so only the first <a href="datatypes-examples.html#Attachment">example</a> has an additional JSON representation.
</p>
<p>
Complex data types may be "profiled". A <a href="structuredefinition.html">Structure Definition</a> or type "constraint" makes 
a set of rules about which elements SHALL have values, and what the possible 
values are.

</p>

<p>
This type is for containing or referencing attachments - additional data content defined in other 
formats. The most common use of this type is to include images or reports in 
some report format such as PDF. However it can be used for any 
data that has a mime type. 
</p>
[%dt Attachment 1%] 
<p>
The actual content of the Attachment can be conveyed directly using the <code>data</code> element
or a <code>URL</code> reference can be provided. If both are provided, the reference SHALL 
point to the same content as found in the data. The reference can never be reused to point to
some different data (i.e. the reference is version specific). The <code>URL</code> reference SHALL 
point to a location that resolves to actual data; some URIs such as cid: meet this requirement. 
If the URL is a relative reference, it is interpreted in the same way as a <a href="references.html#references">resource reference</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>contentType</code> element SHALL always be populated when the attachment contains <code>data</code>, and 
MAY be populated when there is a <code>url</code>. It can include charset information 
and other mime type extensions as appropriate. If there is no character set in the <code>contentType</code>
then the correct course of action is undefined, though some media types may define a default
character set and/or the correct character set may be able to be determined by inspection of the content.
</p>
<p>
The <code>hash</code> is included so that applications can verify that the content returned by the URL has not changed. 
</p>
<p>
In many cases where Attachment is used, the cardinality is &gt;1. A valid use of repeats is to convey the same content in different mime types and languages.
Guidance on the meaning of repeating elements SHALL be provided in the definition of the repeating resource element or extension that references this type.
The language element describes the language of the attachment using the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">codes defined in BCP 47</a>.
</p>
<div class="use">
<p><b>Constraints</b></p>
[%dt.constraints Attachment%]
<p>
If neither <code>data</code> nor a <code>URL</code> 
is provided, the value should be understood as an assertion that no content for 
the specified <code>mimeType</code> and/or <code>language</code> is available for the combination of  <code>language</code> and <code>contentType</code>.
</p>

The context of use may frequently make rules about the kind of attachment
(and therefore, the kind of mime types) that can be used.

<p style="background-color: gainsboro; padding: 4px; margin-top: 0px">

</p>
<p>
A Coding is a representation of a defined concept using a symbol from a defined "code system"
- see <a href="terminologies.html">Using Codes in resources</a> for more details.
</p>

[%dt Coding 2%]

<p>
The meaning of the Coding is defined by the code. The <code>system</code> provides
the source of the definition of the code, along with an optional version reference.
The display is a human display for the text defined by the system - it adds no other 
value.
</p>
<p>
The <code>system</code> is a URI that references the code system that defines the <code>code</code>. 
Choosing the correct system is important; for more information about the code system 
URI, read <a href="terminologies.html#system">Managing Terminology System URIs</a>.
The system URI SHALL NOT contain a reference to a value set (e.g. ValueSet.url). 
If the code is taken from a ValueSet with an inline code system, <code>ValueSet.codeSystem.system</code>,
is the correct value for the system uri.
</p>
<p>
A code system version may also be supplied. If the meaning of codes within the code system is consistent across releases, this is not required. 
The version SHOULD be exchanged when this the system does not maintain consistent definitions across versions.
Note that the following systems SHOULD always have a version specified:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>National releases of SNOMED CT (consistency of definitions varies amongst jurisdictions, and some jurisdictions may make their own rules on this)</li>
 <li>Various versions of ICD (note: the major releases are labelled as different code systems altogether, but there is veration within versions)</li>
</ul>
<p>
More generally, any classification (e.g.  a code system that includes concepts with relative definitions such as "not otherwise coded"
will require a version. See the <a href="valueset.html#versioning">discussion of code system versions in the Value Set resource</a> for 
further discussion on versioning.
</p>

<p>
If present, the <code>code</code> SHALL be a syntactically correct symbol as defined by the <code>system</code>.
In some code systems such as SNOMED CT, the symbol may be an expression composed of other predefined symbol (e.g. post-coordination). 
Note that codes are case sensitive unless specified otherwise by the code system. The <code>display</code> 
is a text representation of the code defined by the <code>system</code> and is used to display 
the meaning of the code by an application that is not aware of the <code>system</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Where the code system defines multiple possible display strings, one of these SHALL be used in <code>display</code>. 
If one is labeled as preferred, it SHOULD be used. If the code system does not define a text representation 
(e.g. SNOMED CT Expressions) then <code>display</code> cannot be populated, and the meaning of the code won't be 
accessible to systems that don't understand the code expression.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the <code>system</code> may not be known - only the code is known. 
In this case, no useful processing of the code may be performed unless
the system can be safely inferred by the context. 
This practice should be avoided where possible, as 
information sharing in a wider context is very likely to arise eventually, and codes cannot
be used in the absence of a known system.
</p>
<p>
If the system is present, and there is no code, then this is understood to mean that there
is no suitable code in the system in which to represent the code. 
</p>
<p>
If two codings have the same <code>system</code>, <code>version</code> and <code>code</code> then they have the same meaning.
If the version information is missing, or the <code>system</code>, <code>version</code> or the <code>code</code> elements differ, then 
how they codes are related can only be determined by consulting the definitions of the system(s) and any <a href="conceptmap.html">mappings</a> available.
</p>
<p>
A coding may be marked as a "userSelected" if a user selected the particular coded value 
in a user interface (e.g. the user selects an item in a pick-list). If a user selected coding exists, 
it is the preferred choice for performing translations etc. 
</p>

<div class="use">
<p><b>Constraints</b></p>
[%dt.constraints Coding%]
<p>
The context of use (as defined in the resource or applicable profile) usually makes rules about what codes and systems are allowed or required in a 
particular context by <a href="terminologies.html">binding</a> the element to a value set.
</p>
</div>


<p>
Coding is used in the following places: [%dtusage Coding%]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Design Note</b>: This specification defines two types for representing coded values:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Coding</b>: a simple direct reference to a code defined by a code system</li>
 <li><b>CodeableConcept</b>: a text description and/or a list of Codings (i.e. a list of references to codes defined by code systems)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>Coding</code> data type corresponds to the simple case of selecting 
a single code from a code list. However this type is rarely used in the 
FHIR specifications; long experience with exchanging coded values in
HL7 shows that in the general case, systems need to able to exchange
multiple translation codes, and/or an original text. 
</p>
<p>
The <code>Coding</code> data type is used directly  when there is certainty that the value 
must be selected directly from one of the available codes, and the list of 
possible codes is agreed to by all participants. This is not usually the case
in the context of FHIR - general interoperability - so Coding is mostly used
in extensions, which are usually intended to be defined for a well-controlled context of use.

</p>
<p>
A CodeableConcept represents a value that is usually supplied by providing a reference to one or more terminologies or ontologies, but may also be defined by the 
provision of text. This is a common pattern in healthcare data.
</p>
[%dt CodeableConcept 3%]
<p>
Each <code>coding</code> is a representation of the concept as described above. The concept may be coded multiple times in different code systems (or even 
multiple times in the same code systems, where multiple forms are possible, such as 
with SNOMED CT). The different codings may have slightly different granularity due to the differences 
in the definitions of the underlying codes. There is no meaning associated with the ordering of <code>coding</code> within a <code>CodeableConcept</code>. 
A typical use of <code>CodeableConcept</code> is to send the local code that the concept was coded with, and also one or more translations to publicly defined 
code systems such as LOINC or SNOMED CT. Sending local codes is useful and important for the purposes of debugging and integrity auditing.

Whether or not <code>coding</code> elements are present, the <code>text</code> 
is the representation of the concept as entered or chosen by the user, and which most closely 
represents the intended meaning of the user or concept. Very often the <code>text</code> 
is the same as a <code>display</code> of one of the codings. One of the codings 
may be flagged as the userSelected - the code or concept that the user actually selected directly. 
When none of the <code>coding</code> elements is marked as userSelected, the text (if present)
is the preferred source of meaning.

Common factors in the numerator and denominator are not automatically cancelled out. The Ratio 
data type is used for titers (e.g., "1:128") and other quantities produced by laboratories that 
truly represent ratios. Ratios are not simply "structured numbers" - for example blood pressure measurements 
(e.g. "120/60") are not ratios. In addition, ratios are used where common factors in the numerator 
and denominator do not cancel out. The most common example of this is where the ratio represents a 
unit cost, and the numerator is a currency (e.g. 50/$10).

A proper ratio has both a numerator and a denominator; however these are not mandatory in order

<p>
A numeric or alphanumeric string that is associated with a single object or entity within a given system. 
Typically, identifiers are used to connect content in resources to external content available in other frameworks or protocols.
Identifiers are associated with objects, and may be changed or retired due to human or system process and
errors. 
</p>

[%dt Identifier 9%]

<p>
The <code>system</code> referred to by means of a URI defines how the identifier is defined (i.e. how the value is made unique). 
It might be a specific application or a recognized standard/specification for a set or identifiers
or a way of making identifiers unique. The <code>value</code> SHALL be unique within the defined <code>system</code>
and have a consistent meaning wherever it appears. Both <code>system</code> and <code>value</code> are always case sensitive.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the system the provides a uniqueness scope, and the value, identifiers may also have a
<code>type</code>, which may be useful when a system encounters identifiers with unknown system values. 
Note, however, that the type of an identifier is not a well controlled vocabulary with wide variations
in practice. The <code>type</code> deals only with general categories of identifiers and SHOULD not be 
used for codes that correspond 1..1 with the Identifier.system. Some identifiers may fall into multiple 
categories due to variations in common usage.
</p>
<p>
FHIR defines <a href="identifier-registry.html">some useful URIs directly</a>. OIDs (urn:oid:) and UUIDs (urn:uuid:) 
may be registered in the <a href="http://hl7.org/oid">HL7 OID registry</a> and should be if the 
content is shared or exchanged across institutional boundaries. If the identifier itself 
is naturally globally unique (e.g. an OID, a UUID, or a URI with no trailing local part), 
then the <code>system</code> SHALL be "urn:ietf:rfc:3986", and the URI is in the <code>value</code>.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, the system may not be known - only the value is known (e.g. a simple device that scans a barcode), 
or the system is known implicitly (simple exchange in a limited context, often driven by barcode readers). 
In this case, no useful matching may be performed using the value unless the system can be safely inferred by the 
context. This practice should be avoided where possible, as 
information sharing in a wider context is very likely to arise eventually, and values without a system are inherently limited in use.

Names may be changed or repudiated.  People may have different names in different 
contexts. Names may be divided into parts of different type that have variable 
significance depending on context, though the division into parts is not always 
significant. With personal names, the different parts may or may not be imbued with
some implicit meaning; various cultures associate different importance with the 
name parts and the degree to which systems SHALL care about name parts around the

<p>
The multiple give and family name parts combine to form a single name. Multiple given and family names are for
when a person's name has multiple given names (relatively common across cultures) and multiple surnames (less common).
Where a person has alternate names that may be used in place of each other, these are different
instances of <code>HumanName</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>text</code> element specifies the entire name as it should be represented. This
may be provided instead of or as well as specific parts, and can be built from the parts, though
the correct order of assembly is culture dependent: the order of the  parts within a given part type has 
significance and SHALL be observed. The appropriate order between 
family name and given names depends on culture and context of use.
</p>
<p>
The parts of a name SHOULD NOT contain whitespace. For family name, hyphenated  names such as "Smith-Jones" are a 
single name, but names with spaces such as "Smith Jones" are broken into multiple parts. 
For given names, initials may be used in place of the full name if that is all that is recorded. 
Systems that operate across cultures should generally rely on the text form for presentation, and 
use the parts for index/search functionality. For this reasons, applications SHOULD populate the 
text element for future robustness.
</p>
<p>
Applications updating a name SHALL ensure either that the text and the parts 
are in agreement, or that only one of the two is present. Systems that do not 
support as many name parts as are provided in an instance may wish to append 
some of the parts together using spaces

<p>
A Signature holds an electronic representation of a signature and its supporting context in a FHIR accessible form. 
The signature may either be a cryptographic type (XML DigSig or a JWT), which is able to provide non-repudiation proof, or 
it may be a graphical image that represents a signature or a signature process.

<p>
Note: One consequence of signing the document is that URLs, identifiers and internal references are frozen and 
cannot be changed. This might be a desired feature, but it may also cripple interoperability between closed 
ecosystems where <a href="managing.html">re-identification</a> frequently occurs. For this reason, it is 
recommended that systems consider carefully the impact of any signature processes. The impact of signatures
on <a href="documents.html">Document bundles</a> and their related processes is the most well understood
use of digital signatures.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>XML Signature rules</h3>
<p>
When the signature is an XML Digital Signature (contentType = application/signature+xml), the following rules apply:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The Signature.blob is base64 encoded XML-Signature</li>
 <li>The XML-Signature is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/#def-SignatureDetached">Detached</a> Signature (where the content that is signed is separate from the signature itself)</li> 
 <li>The Signature SHOULD conform to XAdES-X-L for support of Long Term signatures. The XAdES-X-L specification adds the timestamp of the signing, inclusion of the signing certificate, and statement of revocation</li>
 <li>When FHIR Resources are signed, the signature is accross the <a href="xml.html#canonical">Canonical XML form</a> of the resource(s)</li>
 <li>The Signature SHOULD use the hashing algorithm sha256. Signature validation policy will apply to the signature and determine acceptability</li>
 <li>The Signature SHALL include a “CommitmentTypeIndication” element for the Purpose(s) of Signature. The Purpose can be the action being attested to, or the role associated with the signature. The value shall come from ASTM E1762-95(2013). The Signature.type shall contain the same values as committmentTypeIndication</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are three levels of signature verification: 
<ol>
   <li>	verifying that the Digital Signature block itself has integrity through verifying the signature across the XML-Signature, </li>
   <li> confirming that the signer was authentic, not revoked, and appropriate to the signature purpose, </li>
   <li> confirming that the signed content of interest is unmodified using the hash algorithm.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Deviations from these guidelines would need to be expressed in site policy, and would be enumerated in the XML-Signature block. 
For example some environments may choose a different XAdES profile, hashing algorithm, policy identifier, or signature purpose vocabulary.

Systems that do not have structured annotations simply communicate a single annotation with no author or time.

<p>
This element may need to be included in narrative because of the potential for modifying information. 
</p>
<p>
Annotations <b>SHOULD NOT</b> be used to communicate "modifying" information that could be computable 
(this is a SHOULD because enforcing user behavior is nearly impossible).
