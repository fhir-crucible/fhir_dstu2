  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Patient|Practitioner|Group|Device)
  Short Label = The subject of the set of documents

The documents can be about a person, (patient or healthcare practitioner), a device (i.e. machine) or even a group of subjects (such as a document about a herd of farm animals, or a set of patients that share a common exposure). If the documents cross more than one subject, then more than one subject is allowed here (unusual use case)

  Short Label = Intended to get notified about this set of documents
  Definition = A patient, practitioner, or organization for which this set of documents is intended
  Comments = How the recipient receives the document set or is notified of it is up to the implementation. This element is just a statement of intent. If the recipient is a person, and it’s not known whether the person is a patient or a practitioner, RelatedPerson would be the default choice
  RIM Mapping = .participation[typeCode=IRCP].role
  XDS Mapping = SubmissionSet.intendedRecipient

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = DocumentManifest.created
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Label = When this document manifest created
  Definition = When the document manifest was created for submission to the server (not necessarily the same thing as the actual resource last modified time, since it may be modified, replicated etc)
  Comments = Creation time is used for tracking, organizing versions and searching. This is the creation time of the document set, not the documents on which it is based
  RIM Mapping = .participation[typeCode=AUT].time
  XDS Mapping = SubmissionSet.submissionTime
  w5 = when.done

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Element = !DocumentManifest.supersedes
  Card. = 0..1

  Type = Reference(DocumentManifest)
  Short Label = If this document manifest replaces another
  Definition = Whether this document manifest replaces another
  RIM Mapping = .outboundRelationship[typeCode=RPLC].target

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------
  Element = DocumentManifest.description
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Human-readable description (title)
  Definition = Human-readable description of the source document. This is sometimes known as the \"title\"
  Requirements = Helps humans to assess whether the document is of interest
  Comments = What the document is about, rather than a terse summary of the document. It is commonly the case that records do not have a title and are collectively referred to by the display name of Record code (e.g. a \"consultation\" or \"progress note\").
  RIM Mapping = .title
  XDS Mapping = SubmissionSet.title

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = !DocumentManifest.confidentiality

  Card. = 1..1
  Type = Attachment|Reference(Any)
  Short Label = Contents of this set of documents
  Definition = The list of references to document content, or Attachment that consist of the parts of this document manifest. Usually, these would be document references, but direct references to Media or Attachments are also allowed
  Comments = The intended focus of the DocumentManifest is for the reference to target either DocumentReference or Media Resources, and most implementation guides will restrict to these resources. The reference is to any to support EN 13606 usage, where an extract is DocumentManifest that references  List and Composition resources
  RIM Mapping = .outboundRelationship[typeCode=COMP].target
  XDS Mapping = SubmissionSet DocumentEntry(s)

 -- Row 16 -----------------------------------
  Element = DocumentManifest.related
