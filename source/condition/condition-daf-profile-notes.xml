<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DAF Condition profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for a Patients problem list</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have had a specific condition,problem,finding</li>
	<li>Query for problems experienced by patients during a time period</li>
	<li>Query for problems based on the problem concern status</li>
	<li>Query for problems based on severity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Implementation Guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	<p><b>Representing No known Problems:</b> No known Problems will be represented using the DAFProblem List with no entries and with an empty reason.</p>
	
	<p><b>Specifying Patients as part of the Condition Queries:</b> DAF Condition profile supports the querying the problems for a particular patient. In order to achieve this in implementation, it is recommended to use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the problems relevant to the patient. While other parameters such as  Patient.name, Patient.given could be used for the query, it could lead to incorrect Patient matching and/or inefficient queries when systems are not tuned. </p>
	
	<p><b>Patient Matching:</b> Patient Matching rules and criteria have to be evaluated by the implementing organization and have to comply with local policies and regulations. Query Requestors will have to deal with result sets that can return zero,one or more Condition Resources in response to a query.</p>
	
	
</ul>
