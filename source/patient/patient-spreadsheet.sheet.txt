  Requirements = Needed for identification of the individual, in combination with (at least) name and birth date. Gender of individual drives many clinical processes.
  Comments = The gender may not match the biological sex as determined by genetics, or the individual\'s preferred identification. Note that for both humans and particularly animals, there are other legitimate possibilities than M and F, though the vast majority of systems and contexts only support M and F.  Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosonal, social, etc.)  However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice.  Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosonal and other gender aspects.  For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overrideable error, not a \"hard\" error.

Systems SHALL either handle patient details appropriately (e.g. inform users patient is not human) or reject declared animal records.   The absense of the animal element does not imply that the patient is a human. If a system requires such a positive assertion that the patient is human, an extension will be required.

If the level is finer than species--such as a breed code--the code system used SHALL allow inference of the species.

If you need to convey proficiency for multiple modes then you need multiple Patient.Communication associations.   For animals, language is not a relevant field, and should be absent from the instance.

  Requirements = Most systems in multilingual countries will want to convey language. Not all systems actually need the regional dialect.

  Use = Resource | Instance
  Documentation = This operation is used to return all the information related to the patient described in the resource on which this operation is invoked. The response is a bundle of type \"searchset\". At a minimum, the patient resource itself is returned, along with any other resources that the server has that are related to the patient, and that are available for the given user. The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked practitioners, medications, locations, organizations etc. The principle intended use for rhis operation is to provide a patient with access to their entire record (e.g. \"Blue Button\").  The server SHOULD return at least all resources that it has that are in the patient compartment for the identified patient, and any resource referenced from those, including binaries and attachments. In the US Realm, at a mimimum, the resources returned SHALL include all the data covered by the meaningful use common data elements as defined in [DAF]{daf/daf.html}. Other applicable implementation guides may make additional rules about how much information that is returned
  Type = operation
  Example.Request = $everything-request.txt
  Example.Response = $everything-response.txt
  Title = Fetch Patient Record
  Footer = The key differences between this operation and simply searching the patient compartment are:  \n\n* unless the client requests otherwise, the server returns the entire result set in a single bundle (rather than using paging) \n* the server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones). This frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for\n\nIt is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error. Speciying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification.
