<h3>General Security Considerations</h3>
<p>
Some of the SDC transactions make use of patient-specific information.  Even those that merely retrieve empty forms could
be abused by malicious actors to corrupt the form - resulting in the potential subsequent exposure of patient data.  For 
this reason, all SDC transactions must be appropriately secured with access limited to authorized individuals, data 
protected while in transit and appropriate audit measures taken.
</p>
<p>
Implementers should be aware of the <a href="[%fhir-path%]security.html">security considerations</a> associated with FHIR transactions,
particularly those related to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="[%fhir-path%]security.html#http">Communications</a></li>
  <li><a href="[%fhir-path%]security.html#authentication">Authentication</a></li>
  <li><a href="[%fhir-path%]security.html#binding">Authorization/Access Control</a></li>
  <li><a href="[%fhir-path%]security.html#audit">Audit Logging</a></li>
  <li><a href="[%fhir-path%]security.html#signatures">Digital Signatures</a></li>
  <li><a href="[%fhir-path%]security-labels.html">Security Labels</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
For the purposes of SDC, security conformance rules are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Systems SHALL use TLS version 1.1 or higher for all transmissions containing patient-identifiable information and not 
  taking place over a secure network connection.  Such transmissions SHOULD use bi-directional certificate validation<br/>
  <li>Systems SHOULD use TLS version 1.1 or higher when retrieving Questionnaires intended to capture patient-identifiable information
  to reduce the risk of form tampering.</li>
  (Using TLS even within a secured network environment is still encouraged to provide defense in depth.)</li>
  <li>Systems SHALL use OAuth or an equivalent mechanism to provide necessary authentication (user or system-level)</li>
  <li>Systems SHALL use either IHE's ATNA standard for audit logging or an equivalent using the <a href="[%fhir-path%]auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a>
  resource</li>
  <li>Where workflow requires digital signatures on forms or on answer submissions, implementers SHALL make use of the
  <a href="[%fhir-path%]provenance.html">Provenance</a> resource to record such signatures.</li>
</ul>

<a href="integrity"> </a>
<h3>Transaction Integrity</h3>
<p>
In some cases, the recipient of a completed <a href="[%fhir-path%]questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> may require that the response
be accompanied by a <a href="[%fhir-path%]provenance.html">Provenance</a> or, more rarely an <a href="[%fhir-path%]auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a>
as part of a single unit of work.  (Audit is typically managed by the server and client locally or by a shared service that does not store the
clinical information.)  This can be accomplished by mechanisms outside the scope of this implementation guide by using
FHIR <a href="[%fhir-path%]messaging.html">messages</a> or FHIR <a href="[%fhir-path%]documents.html">documents</a>.  However, within the scope of
this implementation guide, this is accomplished in pseudo-RESTful fashion using the <a href="[%fhir-path%]http.html#transaction">Transaction</a>
mechanism.  Regardless of means, the Provenance and/or AuditEvent event point to the QuestionnaireResponse by full version-specific URL using the
<code>Provenance.entity.reference</code> and <code>AuditEvent.object.reference</code> elements.
</p>

<a href="consent"> </a>
<h4>Consent</h4>
<p>
The SDC workflow envisions the sharing of patient-identifiable healthcare information from 
<a href="conformance-sdc-form-filler.html">SDC Form Filler</a> systems to <a href="conformance-sdc-form-manager.html">SDC Form Manager</a>.
It also envisions transmitting completed forms from <a href="conformance-sdc-form-filler.html">SDC Form Filler</a> to
<a href="conformance-sdc-form-receiver.html">SDC Form Receiver</a> systems.
Where such exchanges take place across organizational or other custodial boundaries, patient consent may be required.  Furthermore,
use of C-CDA data for completing questionnaires for purposes unrelated to the initial population of the C-CDA may also require patient
consent.  It is the responsibility of the client systems to ensure that any necessary consent records exist and are reviewed prior to
each exchange of patient-identifiable healthcare information.  This verification should be logged in the same manner as other transactions,
as discussed above under <a href="#general">General Security Considerations.</a>
