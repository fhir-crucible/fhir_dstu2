<h2>U.S. Data Access Framework (DAF) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG)</h2>
<p>
This implementation guide is prepared as a U.S. Realm Specification on behalf of the 
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/about-onc">U.S. Office of the National Coordinator (ONC)</a>.
However, much of the content is relevant to other jurisdictions.
</p>

<h3>Draft Standards for Trial Use (DSTU) Ballot</h3>
<p>
This DAF FHIR Implementation Guide is submitted as a DSTU ballot.  The focus of the ballot is limited in scope to the IG, the profiles, operations, value sets and conformance
statements it defines.  This guide is based on FHIR DSTU 2 and will be balloted separately from the FHIR specification itself.  
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="daf-intro.html">Introduction</a> - How this project came to be and what the project is trying to achieve</li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.siframework.org/Data+Access+Framework+Homepage">Project wiki</a> containing development materials and discussions. The DAF project wiki contents are not part of the normative ballot content but is provided as additional background reading material.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specification and Conformance Requirements</h3>
<p>
The DAF FHIR IG contains four:
<ul>
	<li>Definitions, Interpretations and Requirements common to all DAF actors</li>
	<li>Conformance Requirements for each DAF actor</li>
	<li>DAF profiles, extensions and constraints</li>
	<li>Security Implementation Guidance</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div>
<h4>Definitions, Interpretations and Requirements common to all DAF actors</h4>
<p>
This section outlines important definitions used in the DAF FHIR IG including interpretations that need to be used in the context of DAF and conformance requirements common to all DAF actors.
The conformance verbs used are defined in <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/conformance-rules.html">FHIR Conformance Rules</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the context of DAF profiles, <i>Supported</i> on any data element SHALL be interpreted as follows:
<ul>
      <li>DAF Responders SHALL be capable of including the data element as part of the query results.</li>
	  <li>DAF Requestors SHALL be capable of processing resource instances containing the data elements.</li>
	  <li>In situations where information on a particular data element is not present and the reason is unknown, DAF Responders SHALL NOT include the data elements in the resource instance returned as part of the query results.</li>
	  <li>When querying DAF Responders, DAF Requestors SHALL interpret missing data elements within resource instances as data not present in the DAF Responder's systems.</li>
	  <li>In situations where information on a particular data element is missing and the DAF Responder knows the precise reason for the absence of data, DAF Responders SHALL send the reason for the missing information using values from the value set where they exist or using the dataAbsentReason extension.</li>
	  <li>DAF Requestors SHALL be able to process resource instances containing data elements asserting missing information.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Value Set bindings and interpretation:</b> In the context of DAF profiles, value set bindings (required, extensible) for specific data elements SHALL be interpreted as follows:
<ul>
	<li>DAF Responders SHALL use the codes from the value sets identified by the DAF profiles, unless the value set does not contain codes that can be used at any level of granularity. 
	For example, if the value set allows red, green and blue and your concept is "navy", you cannot use a new code, you have to use "blue".  However, if your concept is "white", you can use a new code.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>FHIR Infrastructure usage: </b>DAF uses <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful API</a> based on HTTP protocol along with <a href="datatypes.html">FHIR data types</a>, <a href="search.html">FHIR search</a> and both xml and json <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/formats.html">FHIR Resource Formats</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Search Guidance: </b> DAF profiles support the searching (querying) of resources such as Medications, Encounters, Problems, AllergyIntolerances, and Procedures for a particular patient. 
In order to achieve this in implementation, DAF actors SHOULD use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the resources relevant to the patient. 
While other search parameters such as Patient.name, Patient.given could be used as part of the query, incorrect Patient matching could lead to incorrect results. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Patient Matching Guidance: </b> Patient Matching rules and related criteria have to be evaluated by the organization implementing DAF actors to ensure compliance with local policies and regulations. 
The DAF FHIR IG does not require specific algorithms to be used as part of the implementation. 
</p>

</div>

<div>
<h4>Conformance Requirements for each DAF actor</h4>
<p>
This section outlines conformance requirements for each of the DAF actors identifying the specific profiles that need to be supported, the specific RESTful operations that need to be supported,
and the search parameters that need to be supported. 
Note: The individual DAF profiles identify the structural constraints, terminology bindings and invariants, however, implementers must refer to the conformance requirements for details on the RESTful operations,
specific profiles and the search parameters applicable to each of the DAF actors.
</p>
<ul>
      <li>Conformance requirements for <a href="conformance-daf-query-requestor.html">DAF Requestor actor</a>, which is responsible for creating and initiating the queries for information about an individual patient or a set of patients.</li>
      <li>Conformance requirements for <a href="conformance-daf-query-responder.html">DAF Responder actor</a>, which is responsible for providing responses to the queries submitted by the DAF Requestors.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h4>DAF profiles, extensions and constraints</h4>
<p>
This section outlines the DAF profiles created using FHIR resources and include both extensions and constraints on top of the base FHIR Resources.
DAF profiles were created for each conceptual data element identified in the ONC 2014 Edition Standards and Certification Criteria (S&amp;CC) related to Meaningful Use Stage 2 (MU2).
The table below provides a top-level mapping of the ONC 2014 edition S&amp;CC conceptual data elements to the corresponding DAF Resource profile along with the identification of the base FHIR resource. 
In addition, within each profile, granular data elements are listed in the "Meaningful Use Data Element Mapping" section of each DAF profile description. 
While many of these granular data elements were not explicitly mentioned in ONC or CMS MU2 regulations, they are derived from the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC, which references other HL7 standards such as C-CDA, and HL7 v2.5.1 implementation guides for lab reporting and immunizations.  
These standards identify granular data elements to represent the MU2 conceptual data elements and hence are identified in the individual DAF profiles. 
For example, MU2 simply says "Medication Allergies" are required. On review of C-CDA an implementer would find that the Allergy Substance, Reaction, etc. are part of what comprises a Medication Allergy along with specific constraints on what is required and optional.
In addition to deriving the granular data elements from the MU2 conceptual data elements and referenced standards, the DAF community further prioritized these data elements as DAF priority data elements in the individual profiles.
