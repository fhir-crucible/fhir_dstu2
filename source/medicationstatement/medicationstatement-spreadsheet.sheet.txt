=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = MedicationStatement
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Label = Record of medication being taken by a patient
  Definition = A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A medication statements may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now, or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from e.g. the patients’ memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.\r\rThe primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the Medication Statement information may come from the patient’s memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication Administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.

  Definition = External identifier - FHIR will generate its own internal IDs (probably URLs) which do not need to be explicitly managed by the resource.  The identifier here is one that would be used by another non-FHIR system - for example an automated medication pump would provide a record each time it operated; an administration while the patient was off the ward might be made with a different system and entered after the event.  Particularly important if these records have to be updated.

Note: do not use Medication.name to describe the medication this statement concerns. When the only available information is a text description of the medication, Medication.code.text should be used

  Short Label = Technique used to administer medication
  Definition = A coded value indicating the method by which the medication is intended to be or was introduced into or on the body.  This attribute will most often NOT be populated.  It is most commonly used for injections.  Examples: Slow Push, Deep IV.  One of the reasons this attribute is not used often, is that the method is often pre-coordinated with the route and/or form of administration.  This means the codes used in route or form may pre-coordinate the method in the route code or the form code.  The implementation decision about what coding system to use for route or form code will determine how frequently the method code will be populated e.g. if route or form code pre-coordinate method code, then this attribute will not be populated often; if there is no pre-coordination then method code may  be used frequently.
