<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DAFResults profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for lab results belonging to a Patient</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have had a specific lab test result available</li>
	<li>Query for lab results based on type of lab test </li>
	<li>Query for all patients with a lab test (e.g hba1c) beyond the acceptable reference range  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Implementation Guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	<p><b>Using Right DAF Result profile:</b> Implementers are advised to use the right DAFResult profile based on the value to be represented. For example, in case the value element is a codeableConcept implementers should use DAFResultObservationCode profile. Similarly for representing Quantity, Ratio and Other types of results the appropriate DAFResult profile listed above should be used.</p>
	
	<p><b>Representing No Known Lab Results:</b> No Known Lab Results will be represented using the DAFResults List with no entries and with an empty reason.</p>
	
	<p><b>Specifying Patients as part of the Results Queries:</b> DAFResults profile supports the querying the Observations for a particular patient. In order to achieve this in implementation, it is recommended to use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the allergies relevant to the patient. While other parameters such as  Patient.name, Patient.given could be used for the query, it could lead to incorrect Patient matching and/or inefficient queries when systems are not tuned. </p>
	
	<p><b>Patient Matching:</b> Patient Matching rules and criteria have to be evaluated by the implementing organization and have to comply with local policies and regulations. Query Requestors will have to deal with result sets that can return zero,one or more Observation Resources in response to a query.</p>
	
	
</ul>
