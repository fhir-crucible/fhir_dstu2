<h3>Serving Binary Resources using the RESTful API</h3>

<p>
The Binary resources behaves slightly differently to all other resources on the RESTful API.
specifically, when a read request is made for the binary resource that doesn't explicitly
specify the FHIR content types "application/xml+fhir" or "application/json+fhir", then 
the content should be returned using the content type stated in the resource. 
e.g. if the content type in the resource is "application/pdf", then the content should
be returned as a PDF directly. 
</p>
<p>
Note that due to the way the web infrastructure works, it is not possible to make blanket
rules about the relationship between the "Accept" field in the http request, and the 
return type, which is why there is no hard rule about this. However the intent is that
unless specifically requested, the FHIR XML/JSON representation is not returned. 
</p>
<p>
Note that in the native binary representation, the metadata is not available directly,
though some of it is replicated in the HTTP response headers.

<h3>Binary Support</h3>
<p>
FHIR servers can choose to support <a href="extras.html#binary">Binary Resources</a>
at the end point [base]/Binary. The binary end-point accepts
any kind of content, such as images and other media, documents (CDA, 
PDF, Word etc.), plain text, XML or anything else, and stores the 
content as is, along with the content type provided by the HTTP headers. 
</p>
<p>
Binary resources function with the same interactions as described
above. The _format  parameter has no meaning when used with binary 
resources: they are always represented using their original content type.
</p>
<p>
Note that on GET, POST, and PUT operations, the http content-type
header is the mime type of the binary resource, and the HTTP body is
the resource in its binary form. (The <a href="xml.html#binary">XML</a> 
and <a href="json.html#binary">JSON</a> Bundle Representations for binary 
resources are only used in bundles). 
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
Here is the request and response to a read operation on a CDA document:
</p>
<pre>
GET /[path]/Binary/4 HTTP/1.1
Host: [server]
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Searching Binary resources may use the following parameters:
</p>

<table class="list">
<tbody><tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Type</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>_id</td><td><a href="search.html#token">token</a></td><td>The logical resource id associated with the resource (must be supported by all servers)</td></tr>
<tr><td>size</td><td><a href="search.html#number">number</a></td><td>Size of the resource in bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>contenttype</td><td><a href="search.html#token">token</a></td><td>Content Type of the resource</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
