<p>
This is an internal QA page. The intent of this table is to help 
reviewers compare the usage of status codes across resources: 
where the status code means the same thing, it should have the 
same code. The columns have no formal definition; their intent 
is to be inferred from the codes listed in the column.
</p>

<p>
Note: this page is not proscriptive; it's descriptive and comparative,
to help with review. The FHIR methodology says that if two domains
use different terms for the same concept (e.g. 'withdrawn' and 'cancelled') 
then the domain concept name should be used. On other hand, where there 
is no explicit reason for the codes to differ based on domain usage, 
they should not.

Note: <b>bold</b> means the element is marked as a modifier.
