<h2>Profiles defined as part of FHIR</h2>
 
<p>
This specification is a common platform standard that must be <a href="profiling.html">adapted to particular
use cases</a>. 

Some particular use cases are common or important enough to be described as a part of the 
specification itself.
These are published as a "Profile" - a group of <a href="structuredefinition.html">Structure Definitions</a> (Constraints or Extensions),
<a href="valueset.html">Value Sets</a>, and examples that are all defined with a common purpose. 
Additional profiles may be registered on the HL7 FHIR registry at <a href="http://fhir.org/registry">http://fhir.org/registry</a>
