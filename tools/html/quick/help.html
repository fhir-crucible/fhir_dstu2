This reference documentation is a draft of the QUICK logical data model. This data model
is auto-generated from the HL7 Quality Improvement Core (QICore) FHIR Profiles and 
provides an alternate view of those profiles.
 <p/>
 
The QUICK logical model intentionally hides some details of FHIR's physical implementation,
such as the difference between regular elements and extensions. By abstracting away
some of the implementation details, and focusing on classes and attributes, the
features of the logical data model can be seen more clearly. As such, the terms
<tt>class</tt> and <tt>resource</tt> will be used interchangeably in this documentation.
 <p/>

Profiles are represented as classes, so for example, the QICore Procedure profile is
simply represented as the <tt>Procedure</tt> class. Elements and extensions are normalized
and listed as fields on the class with a given type, description, and cardinality.
The fields are classified as <i>must support</i> and <i>is modifier</i>, as defined in
FHIR and the <a href="../qicore.html#mustsupport">QICore Implementation Guide</a>.
When class elements refer to other classes, the reference types are also normalized
from their formal profile names (e.g., <tt>encounter-qicore-qicore-encounter</tt>) to
their logical class names (e.g., <tt>Encounter</tt>).

<h2>QICore-defined Extensions</h2>

QICore adds a variety of extensions to core FHIR classes. These extensions derive from
two primary sources: the Quality Improvement Domain Analysis Model (QIDAM), and the
Quality Data Model (QDM). The logical model represents extensions like any other element,
but annotates them to allow the reader to understand what is and is not a part of the
core FHIR data model.
<p/>

<h2>Must Support</h2>

Certain elements in the QICore profiles are annotated as <i>must support</i>.  These
elements must be supported in Quality Improvement (QI) implementations.  QI
implementations SHALL understand and process <i>must support</i> elements, and those
elements SHALL be available for use in CQM and CDS artifacts. Specific applications
may modify the profiles and annotate additional elements as <i>must support</i>, but
may not remove existing <i>must support</i> annotations.
<p/>

If an element is <i>not</i> annotated as <i>must support</i>, there is no assurance
that an interpreter will recognize or process a quality improvement artifact containing
that element. Although the element may be returned in a resource when the resource is
retrieved from an EHR, no processing involving that data element can be expected. Note
that a <i>must support</i> annotation does not imply that the element will always have
a value (if the lower cardinality is zero). The only assurance associated with a
<i>must support</i> annotation is that the quality improvement application will try to
retrieve the data and process it if the data is available.
<p/>

The <a href="../qicore.html#modifying">QICore Implementation Guide</a> provides further
information regarding the <i>must support</i> annotation.

<h2>Modifying Attributes</h2>

Certain elements in QICore profiles are annotated as <i>is modifier</i>.  These elements
may change the interpretation of the resource, depending on their value. Examples of
modifying elements include <tt>status</tt> (in many resources), negations
(e.g. <tt>Immunization.wasNotGiven</tt>), and certainty qualifications
(e.g. <tt>Observation.reliability</tt>). QI implementations MUST always check the values
of modifying elements.
<p/>

The <a href="../qicore.html#modifying">QICore Implementation Guide</a> provides further
information regarding the <i>is modifier</i> annotation.

<h2>Table View</h2>

The Table View contains three different tabs, representing three different filters of a
class's fields. The first tab lists only those fields annotated as <i>must support</i>,
the second tab lists only those fields that are <i>not</i> annotated as <i>must support</i>,
and the third tab lists <i>all</i> of the fields for the class.
<p/>

The table representing the logical view of the class contains three columns:
<p/>

<table class="overviewSummary" style="border:1px solid black;">
 <tr> <th><b>Column</b></th> <th><b>Content</b></th> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Column 1 <b>(Field)</b></td>
 <td>The name of the element in the resource.
 Names may have a dotted notation to refer to subcomponents of elements (e.g. dosage.method)
 where <tt>method</tt> is a component of the <tt>dosage</tt> element.
  Some names finish with "[x]", which is inherited from FHIR to mean that the [x]
  is replaced with the title-cased name of the type that is actually used. See
  <a href="../formats.html#choice">FHIR spec</a> for  details.
 <p/>
 
 In addition, this column annotates elements using icons to represent <i>must support</i>,
 <i>QICore-defined extensions</i>, and <i>is modifier</i>.

 <p style="margin: 10px">Key: <i class="fa fa-check fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;must support, <i 
 class="fa fa-star fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;QICore-defined extension, <i class="fa fa-exclamation fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;is modifier</p>
 </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 
 <td colspan="2">
 <hr/>
 </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr> <td>Column 2<br/><b>(Card.)</b></td>
 <td>The cardinality is the lower and upper bounds on how many times this element is
  allowed to appear in the resource; e.g., <tt>0..1</tt> is optional and <tt>1..1</tt>
  is required.  <tt>0..*</tt> indicates that there is no lower or upper bound to how
  many times the element may appear.
 <p/>
 </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
 <td colspan="2">
 <hr/>
 </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr> <td>Column 3<br/><b>(Type &amp; Description)</b></td>
 <td>
 <b>type</b><br/>
 The type of the element (hyperlinked to the definition of the type).
 If the name of the element has &quot;<tt>[x]</tt>&quot; suffix then the element can have multiple types.
 Likewise, if the type of the element is <tt>Reference</tt> then the list of clinically 
 relevant resources will be listed. 
 <p/>
 
 <b>description</b><br/>
 A description of the element, and details about constraints that are applied to it.
 Particularly, for coded elements, information about which codes can be used.  
  <p/>
