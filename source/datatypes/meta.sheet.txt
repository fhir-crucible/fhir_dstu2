 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Meta
  Type = Element
  Short Label = Metadata about a resource
  Definition = The metadata about a resource. This is content in the resource that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with version changes to the resource

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Meta.versionId
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = id
  Short Label = Version specific identifier
  Definition = The version specific identifier, as it appears in the version portion of the url. This values changes when the resource is created, updated, or deleted

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Meta.lastUpdated
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = instant

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Meta.profile
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = uri
  Short Label = Profiles this resource claims to conform to
  Definition = A list of profiles [[[StructureDefinition]]]s that this resource claims to conform to. The URL is a reference to [[[StructureDefinition.url]]]
  Comments = It is up to the server and/or other infrastructure of policy to determine whether/how these claims are verified and/or updated over time.  The list of profile URLs is a set

  Element = Meta.security
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Coding
