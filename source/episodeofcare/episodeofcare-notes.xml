<h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
  <p>
    A General Practitioner wants to review how well his patient is managing his diabetes over time from information
    within his clinic and also the regional community care organization's system(s).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Episode Of Care enables him to easily separate the diabetes activities from the mental health problem's activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Community Care organization wants to track all activities that occur with a patient relating to their disability
    to simplify the reporting to the government to receive funding to care for the patient
