<h2>Scope and Usage</h2> 
<p>
A concept map defines a mapping from a concept defined in <a href="terminologies.html">one system</a> to one or more concepts defined in other systems. 
Mappings are one way - from the source to the destination. In many cases, the reverse mappings are valid, but this cannot be assumed to be the case. 
</p>
<p>
Mappings between code systems are only defined in the context of the specified source and destination <a href="valueset.html">value sets</a> - they are specific to a particular context of use. 
The mappings may be useful in other contexts, but this must be determined based on the context of use and 
meaning; it cannot be taken for granted automatically. Note that all code systems have value sets that include the entire
code system, and these value sets can be used for mappings that are valid in all contexts.
</p>
<p>
Each mapping for a concept from source to target includes an [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" 
href="valueset-concept-map-equivalence.html">equivalence</a>] property that 
specifies how similar the mapping is (or, in some cases, that there is no valid mapping). 
There is one <code>element</code> for each concept or field in the source that needs to be mapped.
Each source concept may have multiple targets:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>because there are multiple possible mappings (e.g. ambiguous)</li>
 <li>to specify a correct map, and specify other mappings as invalid</li>
 <li>when there are multiple mappings depending on the values of other elements (dependsOn)</li>
</ul>
<p>
There SHOULD be at least one target for each element, but some incomplete concept maps 
may not have a target for each concept.
