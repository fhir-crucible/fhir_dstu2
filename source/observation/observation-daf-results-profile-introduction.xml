	<h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
	
	
<p>
This profile sets expectations for use of the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resource to record lab results associated with a patient within the <a href="daf.html">Data Access Framework (DAF)</a> Implementation Guide. This profile identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets must be <i>Supported</i> by DAF actors.
For the definition of <i>Supported</i> please refer to <a href="daf.html">DAF FHIR IG</a>. The data elements identified by the profile are based on ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC and DAF use cases.</p> 
<p>Six Observation profiles are defined to cover the various kinds of result values that are generated by laboratories and Ask at Order entry ('AOE') questions.  These profiles are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>DAFObsCoded for coded results. For example, this profile would be used to record a Chlamydia trachomatis RNA PCR result of "Not Detected"</li>
		<li>DAFObsQuantity for quantitative or numeric results with required units and reference ranges. For example, this profile would be used to record a Blood Glucose level measurement of 80 mg/dL.</li>
		<li>DAFObsRange for quantitative results that are expressed as ranges with required reference ranges. For example, this profile would be used to record white blood cells (WBCs) in a urine analysis with a value range of 10-20 WBC/HPF.</li>
		<li>DAFObsRatio for titers with required reference ranges. For example, this profile would be used to record an adenovirus total antibody of &lt;1:8</li>
		<li>DAFObsOther for the remaining result value datatypes  
			<ul>
				<li>Attachment</li>
				<li>dateTime</li>
				<li>Period</li>
				<li>SampleData</li>
				<li>string</li>
				<li>time</li>
			</ul>
			For example, this profile would be used to record a free text entry of a cytology observation, or to record the date of last menstrual period for an ask at order entry question for a pap smear report. </li>
		<li>DAFObsPanel for a panel/battery. This observation lists the set component observations from a panel or battery in the Observation.related element and does not have its own Observation.value.  For example a Chyamydia trachomatis + Neisseria gonorrhoeae RNA PCR (GC/CT) panel would have two references to related observations for the Chlamydia trachomatis RNA PCR result and the Neisseria gonorrhoeae RNA PCR result. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These profile are referenced in the DAF DiagnosticReport profile for one or more lab test results.  They are also referenced for ask at order ("AOE") questions, other clinically relevant questions and for reporting prior results when requesting a test order using the DAF DiagnosticOrder.  Although not specified in this implementation, it may be used in other resources as well.</p>
<p>
The mappings between the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data elements and DAF data elements are captured in the table below, where the first column identifies the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data element name, 
the second column maps the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data elements to DAF data elements which are derived from ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC standards and DAF use cases and lastly the third column identifies the mapping to FHIR resources and attributes.

This profile relies on the following other profiles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="patient-daf.html">DAFPatient</a> which defines DAF Patient profile is used by DAF Result profiles to refer to patients.</li>
  <li><a href="extensibility.html">FHIR Extensibility</a> defines how extensions can be applied to FHIR resources and data types. 
  Specifically the <a href="extension-data-absent-reason.html">data-absent-reason</a> extension can be used to code data elements with missing information when appropriate.
  See <a href="daf.html">DAF FHIR IG</a> for additional guidance.</li>
