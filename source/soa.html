<h2>Introduction: Services, Service-orientation (SOA) and FHIR</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a name="dstu">This page</a> and <a href="services.html">the other FHIR/SOA/Services page</a> will be reconciled and collapsed to a single page during ballot reconciliation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section clarifies what it means to
apply SOA principles and specifications within a FHIR
environment/implementation, and the converse. The use of SOA is an
established discipline and provides a means of encapsulating behavior. Because
the FHIR specification is still at an early stage of development, similar work
within FHIR is presently less well developed. </p>

<p>The potential benefit of SOA to FHIR is
leverage of previous work done in SOA environments thus allowing FHIR to
leapfrog within SOA capabilities so that those developing FHIR implementations
will not have to re-invent these wheels. </p>

<p>One of FHIR's greatest successes lies in
its simplification of implementation. It does not currently contain
out-of-the-box behavior for workflow, behaviors, etc., or well defined APIs. 
The common set of patterns that the SOA specifications provide can be leveraged
to make implementation of complex behavior both more easily and more consistently
than would be achieved without its use. </p>

<p>FHIR offers a highly flexible framework for
interoperability that can be deployed and used in a varity of different ways.
This flexibility can become a liability because systems designed for different
patterns of use cannot easily interoperate. SOA principles can be used to
provide an overall framework that leads to deployment and consistency. SOA
provides guidance for how components interact, how to partition
responsibilities, and how to manage workflows among different parts of systems,
all of which have potential utility in FHIR implementation settings.</p>

<p>Note: FHIR is still under development, and
this section is still under development too.</p>


<h3>Applying Business Context - Joining-up SOA and FHIR</h3>

<p><i>If I am doing FHIR, why do I care about
SOA? Isn't SOA just a technology, and isn't REST either more current or just
what Web Services uses anyway? Isn't REST better than SOAP? </i>
 These are very common questions that surface time and time again
among implementers. FHIR is not a natural replacement for Service-oriented Architecture
(SOA). Nor is SOA “better than” or “worse than” FHIR. If we consider both of
these as approaches, there are natural complements which result in benefits
from applying SOA techniques to FHIR.</p>

<p>One of FHIRs tremendous strengths lies in
its accessibility, ease of implementation, and flexibility to be applied in a
number of different situations without encumbering implementations with
excessive burden. For any one implementation, these strengths stand on their
own, but when multiple implementations need to work together, the likelihood of
having multiple different (and incompatible) FHIR-based solutions to the same
problem increases, resulting in inconsistency and interoperability challenges.</p>

<p>This section assesses different contexts to
allow implementers to make informed decisions about the degree of impact of
applying SOA techniques and to assess potential benefit for specific
situations. It will identify the situational factors to consider, and the
elements of the SOA discipline that can be applied for more effective FHIR
implementation, providing a roadmap on how to optimize your implementation toolkit
to make <i>you and your team</i> most effective.</p>

<h2>Relating SOA and FHIR</h2>

<p>There are a few fundamental aspects of
systems distribution that illustrate the principal differences between SOA and
FHIR. At its core, FHIR is based upon the elemental capabilities of Create,
Read, Update, Delete (CRUD), allowing access to <i>resources</i> where interaction
is primarily based upon these operations. Of note, multi-step or complex
processing levies requirements upon the calling, client application. </p>

<p>The objective of this ballot section is to
identify areas of relative strength and weakness for both FHIR and SOA, and to
identify where there are implementation benefits in applying techniques
spanning the two approaches. This analysis was conducted from two
perspectives:</p>

<p><b><i>SOA in a FHIR
Environment</i></b> considers the benefits of applying SOA patterns and
best-practices to a FHIR implementation community. In these cases, developers
are faced with implementation decisions that have the potential to benefit from
existing case studies, design patterns, or guidance that may either help
provide consistency among FHIR implementations, or which may address gaps -
either known or unidentified - resulting from implicit assumptions around a
FHIR implementation.</p>

<p><b><i>FHIR in a SOA
Environment</i></b> considers the implications of using FHIR in a large,
established enterprise that has or is making investments in SOA
infrastructure. In these cases, shared services, enterprise policies, and
existing infrastructure is common, and FHIR implementations would need to fit
within the fabric of that environment.</p>

<p>It merits mention that not every FHIR
implementation benefits from SOA, and vice-versa. The goal of this section is
to help implementers navigate based upon their specific considerations to help
determine if and to what extent these approaches provide benefits.</p>

<h3>Comparing and Contrasting FHIR and SOA: Background
Context </h3>

<p>In order to best determine the overlaps,
synergies, and alignment points between FHIR and SOA, the following comparative
analysis has been conducted. The table identifies a number of qualities
associated with distributed systems integration, and subsequently provides a
qualitative scoring as to the “fitness” of three different implementation
approaches to support that quality. The scoring is deliberately subjective as
the intention is to help readers navigate to those alternatives best suited to
a given situation. The implementation approaches are broad categories most
exemplary of FHIR implementations, specifically:</p>

<p><i>FHIR + REST</i>, also referred to as RESTful
FHIR, which is the predominant approach for implementing FHIR today.</p>

<p><i>FHIR + WS*</i> represents FHIR implementations
using the web services stack as the communication protocol instead of REST. 
This would include use of FHIR resources as payload parameters in SOAP calls,
for example.</p>

<p><i>FHIR + SOA Pattern</i> illustrates the
impact of applying interaction patterns, exception handing and role definition,
guided by SOA practices, atop an implementation technology (SOAP, REST, or
others). </p>

</table>



<p><i>Sequencing</i>
of events, particularly when those events involve orchestration of complex or
dynamic processes, can benefit from the application of SOA techniques and
patterns. This is common where multi-step processing is involved, and
particularly important when adjustments to a process flow can be made based
upon situational context. SOA design patterns are frequently used to govern
interactions for dynamic processes, non-sequential workflows, or dynamic
workflows involving human intervention and/or consideration of external factors
as part of processing. The ability to model interaction patterns using
languages such as SOAml, and to define roles and role interactions, are tools
that may be useful to FHIR development in these circumstances, and would be
indicators signaling that SOA has the potential to add value to a FHIR
implementation.</p>

<p>SOA design principles can provide guidance
to a FHIR implementer resulting in reduction of co-dependencies between
components, promoting "loose coupling" and minimizing potential impacts
resulting from changes to inner workings of one component adversely affecting
others. (For those familiar with the term, this encourages "black box" implementation). 
</p>

<p>
SOA provides guidance around data persistence, durability, and expectations in
support of the data lifecycle.

<h3>Orchestration</h3>

<p><i>Orchestration</i> is a term typically used within SOA to describe the steps,
sequencing, and dynamic adjustment of workflow to meet a process need. 
Orchestrations may be entirely automated and fulfilled in a short timeline, or
longer and multistep in fulfillment of a business process that may involve
manual steps and human intervention. In the context of FHIR implementation,
orchestration would refer to the sequencing of collections of FHIR (or service)
calls that are used in tandem to fulfil a specific need. </p>

<p>Orchestration is neither natively supported
nor unsupported in FHIR, save the availability of the FHIR Batch mode which
allows for some degree of compounding of operations. In a SOA environment,
orchestration is typically realized by documenting in some formalism, such as
Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), a sequence of steps and flows, and
inherent logic or decision-points affecting that flow. An engine is then
capable of executing the process flow, receiving inputs during execution to
adjust or adapt those processes based upon situational need as part of delivery
fulfillment. </p>

<p>There are many examples where this approach
is advantageous. For example, in a Care Management situation, test results,
current problems, chief complaint, and potentially even resource availability
might affect subsequent steps in fulfilling a care plan. Based upon changes to
any of these factors, the sequence of calls and ultimately the systems or FHIR
servers involved would vary. The role of automated clinical decision support is
another example that naturally ties to workflow orchestration, adjusting care
pathways based upon patient evaluation and affecting process flows within a
health system.</p>

<p>At present, to support this complexity
within a FHIR setting without the use of SOA tools, these flows would need to
be manually coded, either by having a directed sequence of calls, or by
creating an independent capability effectively acting as an orchestrator. 
This can be supported within FHIR exclusively, but all of the steps and corresponding
state management would need to be done by hand. FHIR Batch provides some of
this capability, allowing for aggregation of multiple steps, but does not
necessarily support the event processing needed in complex workflow situations.</p>

<h2>Approach Alternatives </h2>

<p>Recognizing that there are situations where
the coming-together of FHIR implementation and SOA techniques are advantageous,
there are several implementation approaches available. Note that the selection
of which approach is advantageous for any given situation will depend upon a
variety of factors: existing legacy implementation and available APIs
(particularly for interfacing applications), the strategic direction/IT roadmap
of the organization, and so on. </p>

<ul>

<li>
"Full Support in FHIR" Approach. This
alternative involves simplification of the exposed behaviors of the
service/server so as to be supported within the REST protocol, thus allowing
full support within FHIR. Behind a FHIR technology stack, SOA design
principles such as loose coupling and "black box" API design would be coded to
create service autonomy. </li>

<li>
"Classic SOA with FHIR Payload" Approach. This
alternative is attractive particularly in enterprises that have or are making
investments in SOA infrastructure. This alternative relies upon traditional
SOA service definition, leveraging use of FHIR Resources as the parameters into
and out of the service. </li>

</ul>

<p>It is important to note that electing to
apply SOA patterns to FHIR implementation does not fundamentally change the
nature of what is being implemented. <b><i>Applied correctly, it results in
minor adaptation to coding and interface design resulting in enhanced
consistency across implementations as well as enhanced interoperability and
robustness.</i></b></p>

<h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>

<p>Should the above evaluation factors result
in a determination that FHIR/SOA guidance is useful, this section will describe
specific implementation considerations to take into account. Please note that
it is particularly important to determine which high-level categorization best
fits your situation. For each high-level alternative, we present several
implementation factors affected by the use of FHIR combined with SOA in that
context. These "dimensions" apply to any implementation, and are described in
the context of each category to illustrate their implications and differentiate
among the approach alternatives. </p>

<p>We anticipate that future guidance will
mature this thinking, providing code examples and prescriptive techniques more
akin to an implementation guide.</p>

<h4>SOA in a FHIR Environment </h4>

<p>
<i>("A FHIR Environment into which we are applying SOA Techniques")</i>
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Data Storage and Coherence.</u></b> Within a FHIR environment, storage
is managed within the FHIR server, consistent with non-SOA FHIR
implementations. Data consistency is the responsibility of the Server, but responsibility
may carry to consuming applications if they are provided with sufficient update
rights so as to make that a concern. Data validation also has a shared
responsibility, first with the FHIR Server, and additionally with the authorized
updating applications. Data visibility is a product of the REST interface,
typically allowing CRUD operations down to the data element level.
</p>

<p> <b><u>Transactional Integrity.</u></b> 
Updating applications maintain responsibility to sustain transactional integrity
as state management is typically not performed within the FHIR server. The
FHIR specification does not specifically provide for "rollback" in the event of
transaction errors, as may be associated with complex or large transactions
involving changes to multiple resources. If desired, coding will need to be
done to accommodate this capability.</p>

<p><b><u>API/Interface Design.</u></b>The default interface into a FHIR server is REST-based, providing
CRUD operations and allowing for stateless access. The FHIR specification does
not inherently provide for concurrency management (e.g., managing of "deadlock"
conditions where two resources each await update permission from the other). 
As a result, within the FHIR server itself it is assumed that fault tolerance
and server availability is being managed (beyond the scope of the
specification). 
</p>

<p>SOA techniques may be useful in API design
in the form of providing "design patterns" to govern interactions between FHIR
servers and/or between client-to-server communications (such as the "Fire and
Forget" pattern). These patterns can help foster loose coupling within FHIR,
reducing the burden associated with intra-Server implementation and reducing
risks associated with distributed processing. SOA can define encapsulation
techniques to guide which and how FHIR functions are to be exposed. The HL7
SOA Workgroup has a portfolio of Service standards that may be useful in this
regard.</p>

<p>The portfolio of
HL7 Service Functional Models currently includes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>IXS
 (Identification and Cross-Reference Services) that identifies the
 characteristic of a generic identification management services </li>
 <li>RLUS
 (Retrieve, Locate, Update Service) that supports the generic management
 resource in a SOA environment.</li>
 <li>ServD
 (Service directory) that supports the registration and discovery of health
 and human-related services</li>
 <li>CDSS
 (Clinical Decision Support Service) that defines a standard access
 interface to a clinical decision support system</li>
 <li>CTS2
 (Common Terminology Service V 2) that defines the capabilities,
 responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and expected behavior to support the
 management, maintenance, and interaction with ontologies and medical
 vocabulary systems</li>
 <li>CCS (Care
 Coordination Service) that provides the capabilities to support the
 coordination of patient care across the care continuum spanning multiple
 organization [emerging specification]</li>
 <li>OS (Order
 Service) that provides functional capabilities for ordering pharmacy,
 laboratory, radiology, consult and nutritional services individually or
 part of an order set [emerging specification].</li>
 <li>EPSS (Event
 Publication &amp; Subscription Service) that provides a Service Functional
 Model (SFM) for services, components and systems to subscribe to clinical
 events of interest and receive notice when new data are available
 [emerging specification].</li>
 <li>UCES
 (Unified Communications &amp; Escalation Service) xxxxxx [emerging
 specification].</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Error Handling.</u></b>The FHIR specification does not
specifically address error handling between and across servers and clients. 
When implementing within larger or more complex environments, particularly in
situations where multiple FHIR servers may be involved (especially if they are
provided by different vendors/implementations), error handing and management
can quickly become complex and untenable. </p>

<p>SOA provides an implementation approach
providing consistency in error handling, escalation, and error management. 
These tools can be leveraged to identify likely error conditions and exceptions
based upon prior SOA work, helping to put into place infrastructure within FHIR
to manage those exceptions. Moreover, this alignment creates future
opportunity to more effectively integrate FHIR resources into an enterprise SOA
fabric should that become a need.</p>

<p><b><u>Security.</u></b>Identity management, access control, or other dimensions of a
secure solution are inherently part of a service architecture. SOA guidance
can foster an effective design involving FHIR in support of authentication, policy
enforcement, role-based access controls, and a host of other provisions and
protections. It is important to note that within SOA, security is an
established, mainstream, and mature offering. Reuse of these concepts can help
prevent inadequate, incomplete, or ineffective security measures within FHIR,
and eliminate the need to re-invent solutions exclusively for FHIR.</p>



<h4>"FHIR in a SOA Environment"</h4>
<p><i>("Applying FHIR to <b>Enterprise</b>
Solutions")</i></p>

<p><b><u>Data Storage and Coherence.</u></b>In an enterprise environment, data storage and data management are
typically governed by organizational policy. As such, that policy determines
the operational parameters to be satisfied by the implementation. FHIR servers
and their data persistence would need to fit within that policy, with data
access channels into those data stores being in compliance with that policy.</p>

<p>Use of SOA-friendly interface protocols,
such as SOAP and potentially REST, create the access channel for integration.
Depending upon the degree of specificity of the interface, exceptions may need
to be made to allow for use of FHIR Resources as part of parameterized payloads
into and out of these services. Established minimum sets of data may be
required to comply with data coherence expectations (in other words, it is
often required to send data in context, and not just selectively include
specific data elements). The organizations SOA architecture may govern and
enforce these policies. Services have responsibility to interact with
organizational policy enforcement points to assure appropriate permissions are
in place.</p>

<p><b><u>Transactional Integrity.</u></b>In part as a function of the "black box" design approach described
above, data integrity and transactional integrity are in part enforced within
each service as a result of the nature of their exposed APIs. Data update and
integrity becomes the responsibility of each service. FHIR interfaces may be
exposed as part of these services, but would be subject to the integrity
rules/constraints of each service.</p>

<p><b><u>API/Interface Design.</u></b> Services' API design and explicit exposing of service capabilities
is an essential and elemental feature of a SOA architecture. Services provide loosely-coupled
access (e.g., external clients do not have visibility into the inner workings
of a service). Each service exposes specific interface capabilities and
clients must use those capabilities. SOA interfaces are typically aligned with
business functionality and are coarse-grained (such as "Register Patient" or
"Validate Identity", etc.). Note that there is not necessarily a "perfect
match" between SOA operations and RESTful operations -- Finer grained FHIR
interactions may be encapsulated in coarse-grained functions. The API
definition is where loose-coupling manifests in an implementation. Exposing an
API access to the inner workings of a service has onward implications that
potentially limit an ability to undertake technology or design changes within
the service. The goal is to minimize technical dependencies, allowing maximum
freedom to evolve and enhance the way a service operates without affecting what
capabilities it provides. </p>

<p>For FHIR implementations, we recommend
review of the HL7 SOA balloted healthcare standards, as well as reviewing SOA
design patterns. There are many public sources of these patterns available on
the web.</p>

<p><b><u>Error Handling.</u></b> Error handling within SOA is defined and should be directly
leveraged for implementations involving FHIR. We would not anticipate the need
to change error management for FHIR, except to address payload-specific errors
that may arise. </p>

<p><b><u>Security.</u></b>Security is inherently a dimension of any enterprise SOA
architecture, meaning that the responsibility within a service implementation
is to provide the "hooks" to interact with that architecture. In other words,
the service does not need to create or enforce security, it needs to interact
with those enterprise components that have that responsibility.</p>

<p>Enterprises typically have security
architecture into which a SOA environment will have already integrated. 
Service implementations would rely upon this existing infrastructure as part of
authentication, access control, etc. Policy enforcement is a function of the
architecture and not a specific service itself. Services would rely upon
policy enforcement points to govern access to information.</p>

<p>While technical dimensions of security
would be addressed by the security architecture directly, FHIR implementers
should anticipate that data-specific access control policies would need to be
captured and formalized so that they are enforceable within the architecture. 
For example, if a new service is handling protected health information, the
policy enforcement point within the architecture would need to know that the
service has that nature of data.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>FHIR and SOA are not competing technologies;
 rather they are complementary implementation approaches that have the
potential to augment each other dependent upon the context for their use. As
implementation decisions are undertaken, we advise evaluation of the contextual
landscape to determine the degree of SOA applicability to a FHIR project, or
vice-versa. </p>

<p>FHIR has proven itself as beneficial in
that it provides an easy-to-implement and coherent approach to accessing
healthcare resources using a modern protocol stack. SOA has proven itself over
time in multiple vertical market segments as a way to divide responsibilities
and authoritatively manage information across distributed systems. Marrying
the discipline of SOA with the implementation ease of FHIR is a winning
combination when the situation warrants.</p>

<p>Note that this section is less about a technology
protocol as it is about alignment and architectural fit, such as encapsulating
behavior, data representation in service calls, and division of
responsibilities between a service implementation and the service consumers and
other supporting services. We envision maturing this section to include
specific service examples, exemplary code, and potentially self-evaluation
checksheets or maturity models to help guide implementers toward effective solutions.
