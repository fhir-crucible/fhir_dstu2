<h2>Implementation Guides defined as part of FHIR</h2>
 
<p>
An Implementation Guide is a collection of <a href="profiling.html">Profiles</a>, and <a href="conformance.html">Conformance Statements</a>, 
including <a href="valueset.html">ValueSets</a> and other resources, together with textual guidance, that provides instruction
on how to make use of FHIR in a particular problem space.  Implementation guides may be developed and published as part of
a FHIR release or as separate specifications.  Additional support and tooling for implementation guides is being developed, so
the content provided here should be considered "preliminary" from a publication perspective.
</p>
<p>
Note: At present, some implementation guides are published in conjunction with the FHIR specification because tooling that supports
straightforward independent publication is not yet developed.  However, the intention is that in the future implementation guides
will be published separately from the core FHIR specification. The various implementation guides are subject to separate ballots 
than the FHIR specification. There is a registry of <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Profiles_from_other_Organizations">additional implementation guides</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The predominance of US implementation guides in this specification is a reflection of the current point in 
the lifecycle of standards development for the US program.  It should in no way be interpreted as suggesting
that FHIR is a US-centric specification.
