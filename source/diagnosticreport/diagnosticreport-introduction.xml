<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
A diagnostic report is the set of information that is typically provided by a diagnostic service
when investigations are complete. The information includes a mix of atomic results, text reports, images,
and codes. The mix varies depending on the nature of the diagnostic procedure, and sometimes on the nature
of the outcomes for a particular investigation.  In FHIR, the report can conveyed in a variety of ways including a <a href="documents.html">Document</a>, <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a>, or <a href="messaging.html">Messaging </a> framework.  Included within each of these, would be the DiagnosticReport resource itself.
</p>
<p>
The DiagnosticReport resource has information about the diagnostic report itself, and about the subject and, in the case of lab tests, the specimen of the report.  It can also refers to the request details and atomic observations details or image instances.  Report conclusions can be expressed as a simple text blob, structured coded data or as an attached fully formatted report such as a PDF.</p>
<p>
The DiagnosticReport resource is suitable for the following kinds of diagnostic reports:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Laboratory (Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Microbiology, etc.)</li>
 <li>Pathology / Histopathology / related disciplines</li>
 <li>Imaging Investigations (x-ray, CT, MRI etc.)</li>
 <li>Other diagnostics - Cardiology, Gastroenterology etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The DiagnosticReport resource is not intended to support cumulative result presentation (tabular presentation of past and present results in the resource).
The DiagnosticReport resource does not yet provide full support for detailed structured reports of sequencing; this is planned for a future release.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<!--p>
The DiagnosticReport resource has the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>status, issued, identifier, performer, category: information about the diagnostic report itself</li>
 <li>subject, diagnostic[x]: information about the subject of the report</li>
 <li>request details: a reference to 0 or more <a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder resources</a> to allow the report to connect to clinical work flows</li>
 <li>results: a reference to 0 or more <a href="observation.html">Observation resources</a> which provide
    a hierarchical tree of groups of results</li>
 <li>specimen details: a reference to 0 or more <a href="specimen.html">Specimen resources</a> on which the report is based</li>
 <li>conclusion, codedDiagnosis: support for structured reporting</li>
 <li>images, representation: image and media representations of the report and supporting images</li>
</ul-->

<b>Diagnostic Report Names</b>

<p>
The words "tests", "results", "observations", "panels" and "batteries" are often used interchangeably when describing
the various parts of a diagnostic report. This leads to much confusion. The naming confusion is
worsened because of the wide variety of forms that the result of a diagnostic investigation can take,
as described above. Languages other than English have their own variations on this theme.
</p>
<p>
This resource uses one particular set of terms. A practitioner "requests" a set of "tests". The
diagnostic service returns a "report" which may contain a "narrative" - a written summary of the
outcomes, and/or "results" - the individual pieces of atomic data which each are "observations".
The results are assembled in "groups" which are nested structures of Observations (traditionally referred to as "panels" or " batteries" by laboratories) that can be used to represent relationships between the individual data items.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Note that many diagnostic processes are procedures that generate observations and diagnostic reports. In many cases, such an observation does not require an explicit representation of the procedure used to create the observation, but where there are details of interest about how the diagnostic procedure was performed, the <a href="procedure.html">Procedure resource</a> is used to describe the activity.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the <a href="observation.html">Observation resource</a>, the DiagnosticReport resource typically includes additional clinical context and and some mix of atomic results, images, imaging reports, textual and coded interpretation, and formatted representations. Laboratory reports, pathology reports, and imaging reports should be represented using the DiagnosticReport resource. The Observation resource is referenced by the DiagnosticReport to provide the atomic results for a particular investigation.
</p>

<p>
If you have a highly structured report, then use DiagnosticReport - it has data and workflow support.  Details about the request for a diagnostic investigations are captured in the various "request" resources (e.g. the <a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder resource</a>) and allow the report to connect to clinical work flows. For more narrative driven reports, with less work flow (histo/mortuary etc) <a href="composition.html">Composition resource</a> would be more appropriate.

<p>
Image and media representations of the report and supporting images are referenced in the DiagnosticReport resource.  The details and actual image instances can be referenced directly in Diagnostic report using the "imaging" element or by indirect reference through the <a href="imagingobjectselection.html">ImagingObjectSelection</a> or <a href="imagingobjectselection.html">ImagingStudy</a> resources which represent the content produced in a DICOM imaging study or set of DICOM Instances of a patient.
