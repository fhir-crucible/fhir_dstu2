<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The NutritionOrder resource describes a request for oral diets (including general diets such as General Healthy diet, or therapeutic diets such as Consistent Carbohydrate, 2 gram Sodium, or Fluid Restricted), oral nutrition supplements (such as nutritionally complete pre-packed drinks), enteral nutrition (tube feedings) and infant formula which govern the distribution of food and nutritional products used to feed patients within an in-patient setting. These nutrition orders are combined with information on a patient's food allergies and intolerances, and ethnic or cultural food preferences (e.g. Kosher or Vegetarian) to inform healthcare personnel about the type, texture, and/or quantity of foods that the patient should receive or consume.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The NutritionOrder resource is used for requesting oral diets, oral nutrition supplements and enteral feedings in an in-patient setting. The <a href="medicationprescription.html">MedicationPrescription</a> resource should be used for requesting parenteral(IV) nutrition and prescribing dietary supplements such as vitamin or mineral supplements.</p>
<p>
The Nutrition Order is a record of the request for the supply of a diet, oral supplement or enteral formulas for a patient. However, to initiate the request requires the use of the <a href="order.html">Order</a> resource and its associated workflow with the Nutrition Order referenced from the Order.details, or by using the Nutrition Order resource in the context of a messaging or service workflow where the request is explicit or implicit.
