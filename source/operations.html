<p>
The <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a> defines a set of common interactions performed on
a repository of typed resources (read, update, search, etc). These interactions follow
the RESTful paradigm of managing state by <b>C</b>reate/<b>R</b>ead/<b>U</b>pdate/<b>D</b>elete actions on a set of identified
resources. While this approach solves many use cases, there is some specific
functionality that can be met more efficiently using an RPC-like paradigm,
where named operations are performed with inputs and outputs (<b>E</b>xecute). Operations are used where the server
needs to play an active role in formulating the content of the response, not merely return existing
information, or where the intended purpose is to cause side effects - modification of existing
resources, or creation of new resourcse. This specification describes a light operation framework that
seamlessly extends the RESTful API.
</p>
<p>
Operations have the following general properties:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Each operation has a name</li>
 <li>Each operation has a list of 'in' and 'out' parameters</li>
 <li>The parameters are either resources, data types or search parameters</li>
 <li>The operations are subject to the same security arrangements as the RESTful API</li>
 <li>The URIs for the operation end points are based on the existing RESTful API address scheme</li>
 <li>The operations may make use of the existing repository of resources in their definitions</li>
 <li>Operations are performed against a specific resource, a resource type, or the whole system</li>
</ul>

<a name="executing"> </a>
<h3>Executing an Operation</h3>

<p>
Operations are (mostly) POSTs to a FHIR endpoint, where the name of the operations is prefixed by a “$” sign. For example:
</p>
<pre>
 POST http://fhir.someserver.org/fhir/Patient/1/$everything
</pre>
<p>
Whenever the operation is idempotent, and the parameters are all simple ones, 
as is the case with the example above) it may be invoked using GET as well.
</p>
<p>
Operations can be invoked on four types of FHIR endpoints:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The “base” FHIR service endpoint (e.g. http://fhir.someserver.org/fhir) – these are operations that operate on the full scale of the server. For example: return me all extensions known by this server</li>
 <li>A resource type (e.g. http://fhir.someserver.org/fhir/Patient) – these operations operate across all instances of the given type</li>
 <li>A resource instance (e.g. http://fhir.someserver.org/fhir/Patient/1) – for operations that involve a single instance, like the $everything operation above</li>
 <li>A version of a resource instance (http://fhir.someserver.org/fhir/Patient/1/_history/4) – for operations that involve a specific version of a specific instance of FHIR data. This is a special case that only exists to allow manipulation of profile and tag metadata of past versions</li>
</ul>
<p>
The body of the invocation contains a special infrastructure resource called <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a>,
which represents a collection of named parameters as &lt;key,value&gt; pairs, where the value may be any 
primitive or complex datatype or even a full Resource. In addition it may include strings that are 
formatted as the search parameter types.
</p>
<p>
On completion, the operation returns another <code>Parameters</code> resource, this time containing one or 
more output “parameters”. This means that a FHIR operation can take any parameter “in” and return a set of 
result parameters “out”. Both the body of the POST and the returned result are always a Resource. 
</p>
<p>
Some operations - ones with simple input types and a single output parameter named 'return' that is 
a resource - can be invoked differently, by using a GET directly, with parameters as HTTP URL parameters. 
In this case, the response is simply the resource that is the return value, with no Parameters resource.
</p>

<a name="defined"> </a>
<h3>FHIR defined Operations</h3>
<p>
This specification defines several operations:
</p>
<%operationslist%>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The special operations on the <code>meta</code> element also operate on previous version (/_history/) - they are the only ones</li>
</ul>

<a name="extensibility"> </a>
<h3>Implementation Defined Operations</h3>
<p>
Implementations are able to define their own operations in addition to
those defined here. Name clashes between operations defined
by different implementers can be resolved by use of the
<a href="conformance.html">conformance statement</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the definition of these operations  or additional run time operations does not
prevent the use of other kinds of operations that are not dependent on and/or not integrated
with the RESTful API, as long as their addressing scheme does not clash with the scheme
defined here.
</p>

<a name="defining"> </a>
<h3>Defining an Operation</h3>

<p>
Each Operation is defined by:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A context for the operation - system, resource type, or resource instance</li>
 <li>A name for the operation</li>
 <li>A list of parameters, with their definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>
For each parameter, the following information is needed:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Name - the name of the operation. For implementer convenience, the name should be a valid token (see below)</li>
 <li>Use - In | Out | Both</li>
 <li>Type - a data type or a resource type</li>
 <li>Profile - a profile that applies additional restrictions about the resource</li>
 <li>Documentation - describes its use</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is a special parameter type called "Tuple" which is a parameter type that has additional
parts. Each part has the same information as a parameter, except for use, which is taken from
the parameter it is part of.
</p>

<p>
The resource <a href="operationdefinition.html">Operation Definition</a> is used to provide a computable definition
of the operation.
</p>

<a name="extending"> </a>
<h3>Extending an Operation</h3>
<p>
Implementations are able to extend operations by defining new named parameters.
Implementations can publish their own extended definitions using the
 <a href="operationdefinition.html">Operation Definition</a> resource, and
this variant definition can use OperationDefinition.base to refer to the
underlying definition.
</p>
<p>
Note that the FHIR specification will never define any parameter names starting with "x-".
</p>

<a name="executing"> </a>
<a name="synchronous"> </a>

<h3>Executing an Operation Synchronously</h3>

<p>
Most commonly, operations are executed synchronously - the client sends a request
to the server with the operation in parameters, and the server replies with the
operation out parameters.
</p>

<p>
The URL for an operation end-point depends on its context:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>system: the url is [base]/$[name]</li>
 <li>resource type: the url is [base]/[type]/$[name]</li>
 <li>resource instance: the url is [base]/[type]/[id]/$[name]</li>
</ul>

<a name="request"> </a>
<h4>Operation Request</h4>

<p>
In the general case, an operation is invoked by performing an HTTP POST to the operation end-point.
The format of the submitted content is the special <a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> format - a list
of named parameters (the "in" parameters). For an example, see <a href="op-example-request.html">the value set expansion request example</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that the same arrangement as the RESTful interface applies
in regard to <a href="http.html#mime-type">content types</a>.
</p>
<p>
If there are no parameters with complex types (including resources) to the operation, and the operation
is idempotent (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">HTTP specification
definition of idempotent</a>), the operation may be invoked by performing an HTTP GET operation where
all the parameters are appended to the URL in the search portion of the URL (e.g. after the "?").
Servers SHALL support this method of invocation.
</p>
<p>
Servers MAY choose to support submission of the parameters multi-part form method as well,
which can be useful for allowing testing of an operation using HTML forms.
</p>

<a name="response"> </a>

<h4>Operation Response</h4>

<p>
If the operation succeeds, the HTTP Status code is 200 OK. An
HTTP status code if 4xx or 5xx indicates an error, and an
<a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> may be returned.
User agents should note that servers may issue redirects etc to
authenticate the client in response to an operation request.
</p>

<p>
In the general case, an operation response uses the same
<a href="parameters.html">Parameters</a> format whether there is one or more
named parameters (the "out" parameters).
</p>
<p>
If there is only one out parameter, which is a resource,
and it has the name "return" then the parameter format is
not used, and the response is simply the resource itself.
</p>
<p>
The resources that are returned by the operation may be
retained and made available in the resource repository
on the operation server. In that case, the server will
provide the identity of the resource in the returned resources. When
resources that are not persisted are returned in the response,
they will have no id property.

<p>
<b>DSTU Note:</b> there is no defined correct way to execute
operations asynchronously. The <a href="messaging.html#operations">messaging page</a>
describes a way to execute operations asynchronously using messages.
