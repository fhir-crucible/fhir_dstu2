        <i>At this time, the code bindings are placeholders to be fleshed out upon further review by the community.</i>

<h3>Communication.sender and Communication.recepient</h3>
    <p>Communication.sender and Communication.recipient allow Patient|Practitioner|RelatedPerson - but it is not unusual to have 
        a communication target - even a defined one - where it is unknown what kind of role the person is playing.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the communication is to or from an individual, whose role is not known (practitioner, patient or related person), -
        for example, only email address is captured in the system; then RelatedPerson should be used by default.
