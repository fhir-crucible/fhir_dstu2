=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Subscription
  Aliases = WebHook, Hook, Routing Rule
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Label = A server push subscription criteria
  Definition = The subscription resource is used to define a push based subscription from a server to another system. Once a subscription is registered with the server, the server checks every resource that is created or updated, and if the resource matches the given criteria, it sends a message on the defined \"channel\" so that another system is able to take an appropriate action
  RIM Mapping = N/A
  w5 = infrastructure.exchange

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Subscription.criteria
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Rule for server push criteria
  Definition = The rules that the server should use to determine when to generate notifications for this subscription
  Comments = The rules are a search criteria (without the [base] part). Like Bundle.entry.request.url, it has no leading \"/\"

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Subscription.contact
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = ContactPoint

  Is Modifier = Y
  Type = code
  Binding = SubscriptionStatus
  Short Label = requested | active | error | off
  Definition = The status of the subscription, which marks the server state for managing the subscription
  Comments = A client can only submit subscription resources in the requested or off state. Only the server can  move a subscription from requested to active, and then to error. Either the server or the client can turn a subscription off
  w5 = status

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Subscription.error
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string

The URI is allowed to be relative; in which case, it is relative to the server end-point (since their may be more than one, clients should avoid using relative URIs)

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = Subscription.channel.payload
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Mimetype to send, or blank for no payload
