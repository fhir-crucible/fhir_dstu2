 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = DomainResource
  English = If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain any narrative
  XPath = not(parent::f:contained and f:text)

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Context = DomainResource
  English = If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources
  XPath = not(parent::f:contained and f:contained)

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Context = DomainResource
  English = If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL be referred to from elsewhere in the resource
  XPath = not(exists(for $id in f:contained/*/@id return $id[not(ancestor::f:contained/parent::*/descendant::f:reference/@value=concat(\'#\', $id))]))

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Context = DomainResource
  English = If a resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT have a meta.versionId or a meta.lastUpdated
  XPath = not(exists(f:contained/f:meta/f:versionId)) and not(exists(f:contained/f:meta/f:lastUpdated))

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = DomainResource
  Type = Resource
  Short Label = A resource with narrative, extensions, and contained resources
  Definition = A resource that includes narrative, extensions, and contained resources
  RIM Mapping = Entity. Role, or Act

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = DomainResource.text
  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = narrative, html, xhtml, display
  Inv. = 1
  Type = Narrative
  Short Label = Text summary of the resource, for human interpretation
  Definition = A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it \"clinically safe\" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety
  Comments = Contained resources do not have narrative. Resources that are not contained SHOULD have a narrative
  RIM Mapping = Act.text?

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = DomainResource.contained
  Card. = 0..*
  Aliases = inline resources, anonymous resources, contained resources
  Type = Resource
  Short Label = Contained, inline Resources
  Definition = These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope
  Comments = This should never be done when the content can be identified properly, as once identification is lost, it is extremely difficult (and context dependent) to restore it again
  RIM Mapping = N/A

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = DomainResource.extension
  Card. = 0..*
  Aliases = extensions, user content
  Type = Extension
  Short Label = Additional Content defined by implementations
  Definition = May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension
  Comments = There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone
  RIM Mapping = N/A

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = DomainResource.modifierExtension
  Card. = 0..*
  Aliases = extensions, user content
  Is Modifier = Y
  Type = Extension
  Short Label = Extensions that cannot be ignored
  Definition = May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource, and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions
  Comments = There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone
  RIM Mapping = N/A
