<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>

<p>
There are a number of issues in which input based on implementation experience is specifically sought during the trial use phase:
</p>
<a name="todo"> </a>

<ul>
 <li>Immunization : Should it be a <a href="immunization.html">separate resource</a> or a <a href="medicationadministration-immunization.html">profile on medication administration</a>?</li>
 <li><a href="profiling.html#dstu">Conformance</a>: How system profiles are used</li>
 <li><a href="managing.html#dstu">Resource Identification</a>: Managing resource identification in distributed systems</li>
 <li><a href="search.html#dstu">Search</a>: How should text search be standardized?</li>
 <li><a href="search.html#dstu-2">Search</a>: How much should _include be standardized?</li>
 <li><a href="security-labels.html#dstu">Security Labels</a>: How much policy can be standardized, and how does this impact on this specification?</li>
 <li><a href="security.html#dstu">Security</a>: What use cases are there for digital signatures?</li>
 <li><a href="clinicalimpression.html#dstu">ClinicalImpression</a>: Content and workflow questions</li>
 <li><a href="careplan.html#dstu">Care Team</a>: Care Team, plus use as a template</li>
 <li><a href="dataelement.html#dstu">Data Element</a>: question about specificity</li>
 <li><a href="riskassessment.html#dstu">Risk Assessment </a>: </li>
 <li><a href="messaging.html#dstu">Messaging</a>: Messaging has not yet been well-exercised at connectathon, so feedback based on implementation is welcome</li>
 <li><a href="bodysite.html#dstu">BodySite</a>: Does this need to be a resource, or can it just be a reusable type?</li>
</ul>

<p>
More generally, there are still many outstanding questions about the Request/Fulfillment cycle (<a href="order.html">Order</a>/
<a href="orderresponse.html">OrderResponse</a> and how various statuses and workflows associated with requests, as well as how proposals 
cascade to plans to orders to downstream/encoded orders, etc. This is a matter of ongoing investigation.
</p>

<h3>Deferred for a future version</h3>
<p>
Some known issues are not addressed in this version of FHIR,
and are intended to be addressed in subsequent versions:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Adverse Event Reporting</li>
 <li>An alarm resource to represent current issues with the patient (e.g. device created)</li>
 <li>Concern Tracking</li>
 <li>Clinical Studies and Protocols</li>
 <li>Aggregated Data Reporting including Public Health Reporting</li>
 <li>Payment related resources, and specifically, an Account resource for payment tracking</li>
 <li>One or more resources for Advance Care Directive / Power of Attorney</li>
 <li>Use of RDF</li>
 <li>A full server side query framework</li>
</ul>
