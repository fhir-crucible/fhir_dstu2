<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The PendedRequest resource provides supporting information for the poll request. The response to 
this is a previously undelivered response or a StatusResponse (or other acknowledgement which may 
contain errors). 
</p>
<p>
This is a formal request for Payors or systems which require such and/or transports which don't 
support a 'Get Operation', for the retrieval of pended, held, resources.
</p>
<p>
A simple PendedRequest, one which doesn't specify: request, include, exclude or period; would return
any pended resource. Specific types of business behaviors may be supported by providing values for the
filtering elements, for example:
<ul>
<li>Get any pended resource - no filters specified</li>
<li>Get deferred response to a Claim - specify the Claim in the 'request'</li>
<li>Get all Supporting Documentation - specify 'SupportingDocumentation' as an 'include'</li>
<li>Get an Explanation of Benefit - specify 'ExplanationOfBenefit' as an 'include'</li>
<li>Get a payment reconciliation - specify a 'period' which contains the expected reconciliation 
creation date, and specify 'PaymentReconciliation' as an 'include'</li> 
</ul> 
</p>
