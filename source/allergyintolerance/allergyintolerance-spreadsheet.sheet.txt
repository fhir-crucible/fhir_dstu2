  Short Label = active | unconfirmed | confirmed | inactive | resolved | refuted | entered-in-error
  Definition = Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential risk, of a reaction to the identified Substance
  Comments = Decision support would typically raise alerts for \'Unconfirmed\', \'Confirmed\', and \'Resolved\' and ignore a \'Refuted\' reaction. In particular, \'Refuted\' may be useful for reconciliation of the Adverse Reaction List. Some implementations may choose to make this field mandatory.

  Short Label = CRITL | CRITH | CRITU
  Definition = Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to the identified Substance
  Comments = The default criticality value for any propensity to an Adverse Reaction should be \'Low Risk\', indicating at the very least a relative contraindication to deliberate or voluntary exposure to the Substance. \'High Risk\' is flagged if the clinician has identified a propensity for a more serious or potentially life-threatening reaction, such as anaphylaxis, and implies an absolute contraindication to deliberate or voluntary exposure to the substance. If this element is missing, the criticality is unknown (though it may be known elsewhere)

  Summary = Y
  Type = code
  Binding = AllergyIntoleranceType
  Short Label = allergy | intolerance - Underlying mechanism (if known)
  Definition = Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction risk.
  Comments = Allergic (immune-mediated) responses have been traditionally regarded as an indicator for potential escalation to significant future risk. Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be allergic (immune-mediated) are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk.  It is acknowledged that many clinicians may not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction.  Often the term \"allergy\" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of \"intolerance\" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts may not be well-defined or understood.  This data element is included nevertheless because many legacy systems have captured this attribute.  Immunological testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis and causative substance , but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance.  If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted.
  w5 = class

  Binding = AllergyIntoleranceCategory
  Short Label = food | medication | environment | other - Category of Substance
  Definition = Category of the identified Substance
  Comments = This data element has been included because it is currently being captured in some clinical systems. This data can be derived from the Substance where coding systems are used, and is effectively redundant in that situation.
  w5 = class

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.lastOccurence
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = dateTime
  Short Label = Date(/time) of last known occurence of a reaction
  Definition = Represents the date and/or time of the last known occurence of a reaction event
  Comments = This date may be replicated by one of the Onset of Reaction dates. Where a textual representation of the date of last occurence is required e.g \'In Childhood, \'10 years ago\' the Comment element should be used.

 -- Row 14 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.note
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Annotation
  Short Label = Additional text not captured in other fields
  Definition = Additional narrative about the propensity for the Adverse Reaction, not captured in other fields.
  Comments = For example: including reason for flagging a Seriousness of \'High Risk\'; and instructions related to future exposure or administration of the Substance, such as administration within an Intensive Care Unit or under corticosteroid cover. The notes should be related to an allergy or intolerance as a condition in general and not related to any particular episode of it. For episode notes and descriptions, use AllergyIntolerance.event.description and  AllergyIntolerance.event.notes.

 -- Row 15 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.reaction
  Card. = 0..*
  UML = right

 -- Row 16 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = SubstanceCode
  Short Label = Specific substance considered to be responsible for event
  Definition = Identification of the specific substance considered to be responsible for the Adverse Reaction event. Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different to the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite substance that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the AllergyIntolerance.substance and ignore the AllergyIntolerance.event.substance
  Comments = Coding of the Specific Substance with a terminology capable of triggering decision support should be used wherever possible.  The Substance field allows for the use of a specific substance or a group or class of substances, for example \"Penicillins\". The specific Substance field could be used for Amoxycillin. Duplication is acceptable when a specific substance has been recorded in the \'Substance\' field.

  Summary = Y
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = Manifestation
  Short Label = Clinical symptoms/signs associated with the Event
  Definition = Clinical symptoms and/or signs that are observed or associated with the Adverse Reaction Event
  Comments = Manifestation can be expressed as a single word, phrase or brief description. For example: nausea, rash or no reaction. It is preferable that Manifestation should be coded with a terminology, where possible. The values entered here may be used to display on an application screen as part of a list of adverse reactions, as recommended in the UK NHS CUI guidelines.  Terminologies commonly used include, but are not limited to, SNOMED-CT or ICD10.

 -- Row 19 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.reaction.description
  Card. = 0..1
  Aliases = Narrative; Text
  Type = string
  Short Label = Description of the event as a whole
  Definition = Text description about the Reaction as a whole, including details of the manifestation if required
  Comments = Use the description to provide any details of a particular event of the occurred reaction such as circumstances, reaction specifics, what happened before/after. Information, related to the event, but not describing a particular care should be captured in the comment field. For example: at the age of four, the patient was given penicillin for strep throat and subsequently developed severe hives.

 -- Row 20 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.reaction.onset
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y

  Short Label = mild | moderate | severe (of event as a whole)
  Definition = Clinical assessment of the severity of the reaction event as a whole, potentially considering multiple different manifestations
  Comments = It is acknowledged that this assessment is very subjective. There may be some some specific practice domains where objective scales have been applied. Objective scales can be included in this model as extensions

 -- Row 22 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.reaction.exposureRoute
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = RouteOfAdministration
  Short Label = How the subject was exposed to the substance
  Definition = Identification of the route by which the subject was exposed to the substance.
  Comments = Coding of the Route of Exposure with a terminology should be used wherever possible.

 -- Row 23 -----------------------------------
  Element = AllergyIntolerance.reaction.note
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Annotation
  Short Label = Text about event not captured in other fields
  Definition = Additional text about the Adverse Reaction event not captured in other fields
  Comments = Use this field to record information indirectly related to a particular event and not captured in the description. For example: Clinical records are no longer available, recorded based on information provided to the patient by her mother and her mother is deceased.
