<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->
    <p>
        <b>These resources have not yet undergone proper review by PC, CQI, CDS, and OO. At this time, 
            they are to be considered only as draft resource proposals for potential submission.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This resource describes the request for the use of a device by a patient. The device may be any 
        pertinent device specified in the Device resource. Examples of devices that may be requested 
        include wheelchair, hearing aids, or an insulin pump. The request may lead to the dispensing 
        of the device to the patient or for use by the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
        The device use request may represent an order or a prescription entered by a practitioner in a CPOE 
        system or a proposal made by a clinical decision support (CDS) system based 
        on a patient's clinical record and context of care.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Certain devices must be implanted via a surgical or other procedure. The data about the implantation or explantation is represented in the Procedure or 
ProcedureRequest resource, as appropriate.

Some devices create observations. These observations are recorded as resources of type DeviceObservationReport.
