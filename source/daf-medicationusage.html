<h4>DAF medication queries and DAF medication profile usage</h4>

<p>
<ul>
	<p>Medication-related resources compliant with DAF profiles can be queried individually (e.g. by querying for a MedicationPrescription) or by querying for relevant types of List (active medications list, discharge medications list, etc.) and using _include to retrieve the items referenced by the list as well.  See the <a href="list-daf-dafmedicationlist.html">DAFMedicationList</a> profile for information on medication-specific Lists.
