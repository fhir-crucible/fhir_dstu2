<h2>Value Sets Defined in FHIR</h2>

<p>
This table contains a list of all the value sets defined as part of the FHIR specification. Some of these 
value sets include codes defined elsewhere, some define their own codes (implicit code system), and some do both. 
Any implicit code systems are case sensitive, though FHIR will never define codes that only differ by case.
