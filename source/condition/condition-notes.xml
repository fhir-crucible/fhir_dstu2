<h3>Use of Condition.code</h3>
<p>
Many of the code systems used for coding conditions will provide codes that define not only the condition itself, but may 
also specify a particular stage, location, or causality as part of the code. This is particularly true if 
SNOMED-CT is used for the condition, and especially if expressions are allowed. 
</p>
<p>
The Condition.code may also include such concepts as "history of X" and "good health", where it is useful or appropriate to make such assertions.. 
It can also be used to capture "risk of" and "fear of" in addition to physical conditions.
</p>
<p>
When the Condition.code specifies additional properties of the condition, the other properties are not given 
a value - instead, the value must be understood from the Condition.code. 
</p>
<h3>Use of Condition.evidence</h3>

<p>
The Condition.evidence provides the basis for whatever is present in Condition.code.
</p>

<h3>Use of Condition.abatementRange</h3>

<p>
A range is used to communicate age period of subject at time of abatement. 
</p>

<h3>Use of Condition.asserter</h3>

<p>
If the data enterer is different from the asserter and needs to be known, this could be captured using a Provenance instance pointing to the Condition.
For example,  it is possible that a nurse records the condition on behalf of a physician.  The physician is taking responsibility, despite the nurse entering it into the medical record.
</p>

<h3>Use of Condition.clinicalStatus</h3>

<p>
The Condition.stage and Condition.clinicalStatus may have interdependencies. For example, some "stages" of cancer, etc. will be different for a remission than for the initial occurrence.
