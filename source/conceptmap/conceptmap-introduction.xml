<h2>Scope and Usage</h2> 
<p>
A concept map defines a mapping from a concept defined in <a href="terminologies.html">one system</a> to one or more concepts defined in other systems. 
Mappings are always framed within the concept of <a href="valueset.html">value sets</a> - they are specific to a context of use. 
</p> 

<p>
Note that the mappings are one way - from the source to the destination. In many cases, the reverse mappings 
are valid, but this cannot be assumed to be the case. 
</p>
<p>
Mappings between code systems are only defined in the context of the specified source and destination valuesets. 
The mappings may be useful in other contexts, but this must be determined based on the context of use and 
meaning; it cannot be taken for granted automatically. All code systems have value sets that include the entire
code system, and these value sets can be used for mappings that are valid in all contexts.
</p>
<p>
Each mapping for a concept from source to destination also includes an [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" 
href="concept-equivalence.html">equivalence</a>] property that 
specifies how similar the mapping is (or, in some cases, that there is no valid mapping).
