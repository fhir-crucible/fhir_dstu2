  Comments = When the dose or rate is intended to change over the entire administration period, eg. Tapering dose prescriptions, multiple instances of dosage instructions will need to be supplied to convey the different doses/rates. Another common example in institutional settings is \'titration\' of an IV medication dose to maintain a specific stated hemodynamic value or range e.g. durg x to be administered to maintain AM (arterial mean) greater than 65.

  Definition = The amount of therapeutic or other substance given at one administration event.
  Comments = Note that this specifies the quantity of the specified medication, not the quantity for each active ingredient(s). Each ingredient amount can be communicated in the Medication resource. For example, if one wants to communicate that a tablet was 375 mg, where the dose was one tablet, you can use the Medication resource to document that the tablet was comprised of 375 mg of drug xyz. Alternatively if the dose was 375 mg, then you may only need to use the Medication resource to indicate this was a tablet. If the example were an IV such as dopamine and you wanted to communicate that 400mg of dopamine was mixed in 500 ml of some IV solution, then this would all be communicated in the Medication resource. If the administration is not intended to be instantaneous (rate is present or timing has a duration), this can be specified to convey the total amount to be administered over the period of time as indicated by the schedule e.g. 500 ml in dose, with timing used to convey that this should be done over 4 hours.

  Card. = 0..1

  Short Label = Amount of medication per unit of time
  Definition = Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into the patient. Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Currently we do not specify a default of \'1\' in the denominator, but this is being discussed. Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours
  Comments = It is possible to supply both a rate and a doseQuantity to provide full details about how the medication is to be administered and supplied. If the rate is intended to change over time, depending on local rules/regulations, each change should be captured as a new version of the MedicationOrder with an updated rate, or captured with a new MedicationOrder with the new rate.

There may be in some settings (e.g. hospitals) institutional or system support for completing the dispense details in the pharmacy department.

  Type = Period
  Short Label = Time period supply is authorized for
  Definition = Design Comments: This indicates the validity period of a prescription (stale dating the Prescription)  It reflects the prescriber perspective for the validity of the prescription. Dispenses must not be made against the prescription outside of this period. The lower-bound of the Dispensing Window signifies the earliest date that the prescription can be filled for the first time. If an upper-bound is not specified then the Prescription is open-ended or will default to a stale-date based on regulations.  Rationale: Indicates when the Prescription becomes valid, and when it ceases to be a dispensable Prescription.

  Definition = An integer indicating the number of additional times (aka refills or repeats) the patient can receive the prescribed medication.   Usage Notes: This integer does NOT include the original order dispense.   This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus  \"3 repeats\", then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient can receive a total of 120 tablets.

  Short Label = Days supply per dispense
  Definition = Identifies the period time over which the supplied product is expected to be used, or the length of time the dispense is expected to last.  In some situations, this attribute may be used instead of quantity to identify the amount supplied by how long it is expected to last, rather than the physical quantity issued, e.g. 90 days supply of medication (based on an ordered dosage) When possible, it is always better to specify quantity, as this tends to be more precise. expectedSupplyDuration will always be an estimate that can be influenced by external factors.
