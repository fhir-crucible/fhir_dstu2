		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
			The HealthcareService resource can be used with the Schedule resource to define actual availability
			of the service. This would be done by using the Schedule's Actor property.
		</p>
		<p>
			When creating an Appointment, the HealthcareService is to be assigned to one of the participants.<br/>
			It is up to the scheduling system to determine if the service is available, and can be accepted.
