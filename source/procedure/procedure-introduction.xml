<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This resource is used to record the details of procedures performed on a patient. A procedure is an activity 
that is performed with or on a patient as part of the provision of care. Examples include surgical 
procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, counselling, physiotherapy, exercise, etc.
Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a friend or relative or in some cases by the patient
themselves.
</p>
<p>
This resource provides summary information about the occurrence of the procedure and is not intended to
provide real-time snapshots of a procedure as it unfolds, though for long-running procedures such as psychotherapy,
it could represent summary level information about overall progres.  The creation of a resource to support detailed
real-time procedure information awaits the identification of a specific implementation use-case to share such information.
</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Procedures do not include actions things for which there are specific resources, such as 
<a href="immunization.html">immunizations</a>, <a href="medicationadministration.html">drug administrations</a>
and <a href="communication.html">communications</a>.  The boundary between determining whether an action is
considered to be training or counselling (and thus a procedure) as opposed to a Communication is based on whether
there's a specific intent to change the mind-set of the patient.  Mere disclosure of information would be considered
a Communication.  A process that involves verification of the patient's comprehension or to change the patient's
mental state would be a Procedure.
</p>
<p>
Note that many diagnostic processes are procedures that generate <a href="observation.html">Observations</a> and 
<a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReports</a>. In many cases, 
such an observation does not require an explicit representation of the procedure used to create the 
observation, but where there are details of interest about how the diagnostic procedure was performed, 
the procedure resource is used to describe the activity.
