
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = IdentifierUse
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #identifier-use
  Definition = Identifies the purpose for this identifier, if known

=== Sheet identifier-use =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = usual
  Display = Usual
  Definition = the identifier recommended for display and use in real-world interactions

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = official
  Display = Official
  Definition = the identifier considered to be most trusted for the identification of this item

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = temp
  Display = Temp
  Definition = A temporary identifier

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = secondary
  Display = Secondary
  Definition = An identifier that was assigned in secondary use - it serves to identify the object in a relative context, but cannot be consistently assigned to the same object again in a different context

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Identifier
  Type = Type
  Short Label = An identifier intended for computation
  Definition = A technical identifier - identifies some entity uniquely and unambiguously
  Requirements = Need to be able to identify things with confidence and be sure that the identification is not subject to misinterpretation
  v2 Mapping = CX / EI (occasionally, more often EI maps to a resource id or a URL)
  RIM Mapping = II - see see identifier pattern at http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Common_Design_Patterns#Identifier_Pattern for relevant discussion. The Identifier class is a little looser than the v3 type II because it allows URIs as well as registered OIDs or GUIDs.  Also maps to Role[classCode=IDENT]
  ServD Mapping = Identifier

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Identifier.use
  Card. = 0..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Type = code
  Binding = IdentifierUse
  Short Label = usual | official | temp | secondary (If known)
  Definition = The purpose of this identifier
  Requirements = Allows the appropriate identifier for a particular context of use to be selected from among a set of identifiers
  Comments = This is labeled as \"Is Modifier\" because applications should not mistake a temporary id for a permanent one. Applications can assume that an identifier is permanent unless it explicitly says that it is temporary
  v2 Mapping = N/A
  RIM Mapping = Role.code or implied by context

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Identifier.type
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = IdentifierType
  Short Label = Description of identifier
  Definition = A coded type for the identifier that can be used to determine which identifier to use for a specific purpose
  Requirements = Allows users to make use of identifiers when the identifier system is not known
  Comments = This element deals only with general categories of identifiers.  It SHOULD not be used for codes that correspond 1..1 with the Identifier.system. Some identifiers may fall into multiple categories due to common usage. \n\nWhere the system is known, a type is unnecessary because the type is always part of the system definition. However systems often need to handle identifiers where the system is not known. There is not a 1:1 relationship between type and system, since many different systems have the same type
  v2 Mapping = CX.5
  RIM Mapping = Role.code or implied by context

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Identifier.system
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = uri
  Short Label = The namespace for the identifier
  Definition = Establishes the namespace in which set of possible id values is unique.
  Requirements = There are many sequences of identifiers.  To perform matching, we need to know what sequence we\'re dealing with. The system identifies a particular sequence or set of unique identifiers
  v2 Mapping = CX.4 / EI-2-4
  RIM Mapping = II.root or Role.id.root
  ServD Mapping = ./IdentifierType
  Example = http://www.acme.com/identifiers/patient or urn:ietf:rfc:3986 if the Identifier.value itself is a full uri

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = Identifier.value
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = The value that is unique
  Definition = The portion of the identifier typically displayed to the user and which is unique within the context of the system.
  Comments = If the value is a full URI, then the system SHALL be urn:ietf:rfc:3986
  v2 Mapping = CX.1 / EI.1
  RIM Mapping = II.extension or II.root if system indicates OID or GUID (Or Role.id.extension or root)
  ServD Mapping = ./Value
  Example = 123456

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Identifier.period
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Period
  Short Label = Time period when id is/was valid for use
  Definition = Time period during which identifier is/was valid for use
  v2 Mapping = CX.7 + CX.8
  RIM Mapping = Role.effectiveTime or implied by context
  ServD Mapping = ./StartDate and ./EndDate

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = Identifier.assigner
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Organization)
  Short Label = Organization that issued id (may be just text)
  Definition = Organization that issued/manages the identifier
  Comments = The reference may be just a text description of the assigner
  v2 Mapping = CX.4 / (CX.4,CX.9,CX.10)
  RIM Mapping = II.assigningAuthorityName but note that this is an improper use by the definition of the field.  Also Role.scoper
  ServD Mapping = ./IdentifierIssuingAuthority
