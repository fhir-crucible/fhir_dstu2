
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = IdentityAssuranceLevel
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #identity-assuranceLevel
  Definition = The level of confidence that this link represents the same actual person, based on NIST Authentication Levels

=== Sheet identity-assuranceLevel =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = level1
  Display = Level 1
  Definition = Little or no confidence in the asserted identity\'s accuracy.

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = level2
  Display = Level 2
  Definition = Some confidence in the asserted identity\'s accuracy.

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = level3
  Display = Level 3
  Definition = High confidence in the asserted identity\'s accuracy.

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = level4
  Display = Level 4
  Definition = Very high confidence in the asserted identity\'s accuracy.

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person
  UML = 0;0
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Label = A generic person record
  Definition = Demographics and administrative information about a person independent of a specific health-related context
  Requirements = Need to track persons potentially across multiple roles
  Comments = The Person resource does justice to Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless of their role. The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role such as SubjectofCare, Practitioner, and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and so Person is kept lean. Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the Person himself. Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Practitioner), and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare)
  RIM Mapping = Person(classCode=\"PSN\" and determinerCode=\"INST\" and quantity=\"1\")
  w5 = administrative.entity

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.identifier
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Identifier
  Short Label = A Human identifier for this person
  Definition = Identifier for a person within a particular scope.
  Requirements = People are known by a variety of ids. Some institutions maintain several, and most collect identifiers for exchange with other organizations concerning the person. Examples are national person identifier and local identifier
  v2 Mapping = PID-3
  RIM Mapping = .plays:Role(classCode=\'IDENT\').id
  Committee Notes = Keeping Person.id cardinality as a matter of safety in the same manner as Person Activate
  w5 = id

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.name
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = Y
  Type = HumanName
  Short Label = A name associated with the person
  Definition = A name associated with the person
  Requirements = Need to be able to track the person by multiple names. Examples are your official name and a partner name.
  Comments = Person may have multiple names with different uses or applicable periods.
  v2 Mapping = PID-5, PID-9
  RIM Mapping = ./name
  Committee Notes = Committee does not fully grasp implications of HumanName datatype, so as a matter of safety decided to have cardinality 0..*. It is not clear to the committee whether or not all 80% name parts can be conveyed in one name instance

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.telecom
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = Y
  Type = ContactPoint
  Short Label = A contact detail for the person
  Definition = A contact detail for the person, e.g. a telephone number or an email address.
  Requirements = People have (primary) ways to contact them in some way such as phone, email.
  Comments = Person may have multiple ways to be contacted with different uses or applicable periods.  May need to have options for contacting the person urgently, and also to help with identification
  v2 Mapping = PID-13, PID-14
  RIM Mapping = ./telecom
  Committee Notes = renamed from contact, because that suggested \"contact party\" at first sight. \"telecom\" is a well-worn path, so without a really good working alternative we want to stick to it

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.gender
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = code
  Binding = AdministrativeGender
  Short Label = male | female | other | unknown
  Definition = Administrative Gender
  Requirements = Needed for identification of the person, in combination with (at least) name and birth date. Gender of person drives many clinical processes.
  Comments = The gender may not match the biological sex as determined by genetics, or the individual\'s preferred identification. Note that for both humans and particularly animals, there are other legitimate possibilities than M and F, though the vast majority of systems and contexts only support M and F
  v2 Mapping = PID-8
  RIM Mapping = player[classCode=PSN|ANM and determinerCode=INSTANCE]/administrativeGender
  Committee Notes = \'gender\' is still the administrative gender, but this is reflected in its description rather than its name.

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.birthDate
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = date
  Short Label = The date on which the person was born
  Definition = The birth date for the person.
  Requirements = Age of person drives many clinical processes, and is often used in performing identification of the person. Times are not included so as to not confuse things with potential timezone issues.
  Comments = At least an estimated year should be provided as a guess if the real dob is unknown
  v2 Mapping = PID-7
  RIM Mapping = ./birthTime
  Committee Notes = renamed from dob, because the abbreviation is not obvious to non-English speakers

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Person.deceased
  Card. = 0..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Type = boolean
  Short Label = Indicates if the Person is deceased or not
  Definition = Indicates if the Person is deceased or not
  Comments = If there\'s no value in the instance it means there is no statement on whether or not the person deceased. Most systems will interpret the absence of a value as a sign of the person being alive.
  v2 Mapping = PID-30
  RIM Mapping = ./deceasedInd
  Committee Notes = there are two choices (a) deceased and date are two separate notions, one who could go in core and one who does not, and not all usecases need both, (b) its one piece of information, and to avoid inconsistencies its better to have one field saying that there is a date, but it is not available/known.

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.address
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Address
  Short Label = One or more addresses for the person
  Definition = One or more addresses for the person
  Requirements = May need to keep track of persons addresses for contacting, billing or reporting requirements and also to help with identification
  Comments = Person may have multiple addresses with different uses or applicable periods
  v2 Mapping = PID-11
  RIM Mapping = ./addr

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.photo
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Attachment
  Short Label = Image of the Person
  Definition = An image that can be displayed as a thumbnail of the person to enhance the identification of the individual
  v2 Mapping = OBX-5 - needs a profile
  RIM Mapping = player[classCode=PSN|ANM and determinerCode=INSTANCE]/desc

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Person.language
  Card. = 0..*
  UML = right
  Short Label = The person\'s  proficiency level of a language
  Definition = A language spoken by the person, with proficiency
  Requirements = If a patient does not speak the local language, interpreters may be required, so languages spoken and proficiency is an important things to keep track of both for patient and other persons of interest
  Comments = If no language is specified, this *implies* that the default local language is spoken. If you need to convey proficiency for multiple modes than you need multiple Person.language associations.
  RIM Mapping = .LanguageCommunication
  Committee Notes = Rationale for putting this in the core is based on input from Canada. Other persons on call are from single language countries. Committee felt uncomfortable with leaving any of the 3 optional attributes modeCode, proficiencyLevelCode, or preferenceInd up to extensions. Instead we said that isModifier is \"no\" on modeCode, and preferenceInd.

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Person.language.language
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = Language
  Short Label = Language with optional region
  Definition = The ISO-639-1 alpha 2 code in lower case for the language, optionally followed by a hyphen and the ISO-3166-1 alpha 2 code for the region in upper case. E.g. \"en\" for English, or \"en-US\" for American English versus \"en-EN\" for England English
  Requirements = Most systems in multilingual countries will want to convey language. Not all systems actually need the regional dialect.
  Comments = The structure aa-BB with this exact casing is one the most widely used notations for locale. However not all systems actually code this but instead have it as free text. Hence CodeableConcept instead of code as the data type
  v2 Mapping = PID-15, NK1-20, LAN-2
  RIM Mapping = ./languageCode
  To Do = So just ISO 639-3?  ISO-639-1 alpha 2 is actually somewhat outdated and ISO-639-2 alpha 3 has support for more languages/dialects.

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Person.language.mode
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = LanguageAbilityMode
  Short Label = Language method of expression
  Definition = A value representing the person\'s method of expression of this language. Examples: expressed spoken, expressed written, expressed signed, received spoken, received written, received signed
  Requirements = A Person that can write English fairly well, but is not capable to understand
  Comments = It\'s expected that modeCode and proficiencyLevelCode work in conjunction. It makes less sense to convey modeCode unless you want to distinctly denote someone proficiency for a particular mode. It\'s however perfectly acceptable to have a proficiencyLevelCode without a modeCode
  v2 Mapping = LAN-3
  RIM Mapping = ./modeCode

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Person.language.proficiencyLevel
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = LanguageAbilityProficiency
  Short Label = Proficiency level of the language
  Definition = A code that describes how well the language is spoken
  Comments = See comments for Person.language.modeCode

  RIM Mapping = ./proficiencyLanguageCode

 -- Row 14 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Person.language.preference
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = boolean
  Short Label = Language preference indicator
  Definition = Indicates whether or not the Person prefers this language (over other languages he masters up a certain level)
  Requirements = People that master multiple languages up to certain level may prefer one or more, i.e. feel more confident in communicating in a particular language making other languages sort of a fallback method
  v2 Mapping = PID-15, NK1-20
  RIM Mapping = ./preferenceInd

 -- Row 15 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.managingOrganization
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = Y
  Type = Reference(Organization)
  Short Label = The Organization that is the custodian of the person record
  Definition = The Organization that is the custodian of the person record
  Requirements = Need to know who recognizes this person record, manages and updates it
  RIM Mapping = scoper

 -- Row 16 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.active
  Card. = 0..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Summary = Y
  Type = boolean
  Short Label = This person\'s record is in active use
  Definition = Whether this person\'s record is in active use
  Requirements = Need to be able to mark a person record as not to be used because it was created in error
  RIM Mapping = statusCode
  w5 = status

 -- Row 17 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.link
  Card. = 0..*
  UML = 350;40
  Short Label = Link to a resource that concerns the same actual person
  RIM Mapping = outboundLink

 -- Row 18 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.link.target
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = Reference(Patient|Practitioner|RelatedPerson|Person)

 -- Row 19 -----------------------------------
  Element = Person.link.assurance
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = code
  Binding = IdentityAssuranceLevel
  Short Label = level1 | level2 | level3 | level4
  Definition = Level of assurance that this link is actually associated with the target resource
  RIM Mapping = priorityNumber?
