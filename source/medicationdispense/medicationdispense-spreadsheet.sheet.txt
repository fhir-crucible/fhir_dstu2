  Binding = MedicationAdministrationMethod
  Short Label = Technique for administering medication
  Definition = A coded value indicating the method by which the medication is intended to be or was introduced into or on the body.  This attribute will most often NOT be populated.  It is most commonly used for injections.  Examples: Slow Push, Deep IV.  One of the reasons this attribute is not used often, is that the method is often pre-coordinated with the route and/or form of administration.  This means the codes used in route or form may pre-coordinate the method in the route code or the form code.  The implementation decision about what coding system to use for route or form code will determine how frequently the method code will be populated e.g. if route or form code pre-coordinate method code, then this attribute will not be populated often; if there is no pre-coordination then method code may  be used frequently.

The prescribed strength can be calculated by multiplying the doseQuantity by the strength of each active ingredient in the prescribed Medication.

  Definition = Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into the patient. Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Currently we do not specify a default of \'1\' in the denominator, but this is being discussed.
