Notes:
</h2>
<ul> 
 <li>The author and the attester are often the same person, but this may not be the case in some clinical workflows</li>
 <li>The attester attests contents of the document resource, the subject resource and the resources referred to 
   in the Composition.section.content references. Because documents are often derived Compositions and the attestation
   from the composition is held to apply to the document, the method for <a href="documents.html#presentation">presenting a document</a>
   should be used when/if attesters review the content of the composition
   </li>
 <li>The custodian is responsible for the maintenance of the composition and any documents derived from it. With regard to the documents, they are 
   responsible for the policy regarding persistence of the documents. Although they need not actually retain a copy of the document, they SHOULD do so.
 </li>
</ul>

<b>DSTU Note:</b> Feedback is welcome on two issues related to Composition:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>For many compositions, the title is the same as the text or a display name of Composition.type (e.g. a \"consultation\" or \"progress note\"). Note that CDA does not make title mandatory, but there are no known cases where it is useful for title to be omitted, so it is mandatory here during the trial use period</li>
 <li>A client can ask a server to generate a fully bundled document from a composition resource using the $generate operation. This operation definition does not resolve the question how document signatures are created. This is an open issue during the period of trail use, and feedback is requested regarding this question</li>
</ul>
<p>
Feedback <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Specification_Feedback_(DSTU_2)">here</a>.
