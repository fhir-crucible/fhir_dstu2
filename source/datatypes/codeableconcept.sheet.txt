 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = CodeableConcept
  Type = Type
  Short Label = Concept - reference to a terminology or just  text
  Definition = A concept that may be defined by a formal reference to a terminology or ontology or may be provided by text
  Requirements = This is a common pattern in healthcare - a concept that may be defined by one or more codes from formal definitions including LOINC and SNOMED CT, and/or defined by the provision of text that captures a human sense of the concept
  Comments = Not all terminology uses fit this general pattern. In some cases, models should not use CodeableConcept and use Coding directly and provide their own structure for managing text, codings, translations and the relationship between elements and pre- and post-coordination
  ORIM Mapping = fhir:CodeableConcept rdfs:subClassOf dt:CD
  v2 Mapping = CE/CNE/CWE
  RIM Mapping = CD

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = CodeableConcept.coding
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Coding
  Short Label = Code defined by a terminology system
  Definition = A reference to a code defined by a terminology system
  Requirements = Allows for translations and alternate encodings within a code system.  Also supports communication of the same instance to systems requiring different encodings.
  Comments = Codes may be defined very casually in enumerations, or code lists, up to very formal definitions such as SNOMED CT - see the V3 Core Principles for more information.  Ordering of codings is undefined and SHALL NOT be used to infer meaning. Generally, at most only one of the coding values will be labelled as UserSelected = true
  ORIM Mapping = fhir:CodeableConcept.coding rdfs:subPropertyOf dt:CD.coding
  v2 Mapping = C*E.1-8, C*E.10-22
  RIM Mapping = union(., ./translation)

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = CodeableConcept.text
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Plain text representation of the concept
  Definition = A human language representation of the concept as seen/selected/uttered by the user who entered the data and/or which represents the intended meaning of the user
  Requirements = The codes from the terminologies do not always capture the correct meaning with all the nuances of the human using them, or sometimes there is no appropriate code at all. In these cases, the text is used to capture the full meaning of the source
  Comments = Very often the text is the same as a displayName of one of the codings
  ORIM Mapping = fhir:CodeableConcept.text rdfs:subPropertyOf dt:CD.originalText
  v2 Mapping = C*E.9. But note many systems use C*E.2 for this
  RIM Mapping = ./originalText[mediaType/code=\"text/plain\"]/data
