			<p>This value sets refers to 3 different sources of observation method codes, each with issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>SNOMED CT Techniques (descendents of 272394005): As for August 2015, this is relatively complete (e.g. includes all LOINC methods ). However this includes more than just observation methods, and is subject to the normal SNOMED CT licensing rules</li>
				<li>v3 Code System &quot;ObservationMethod&quot;: this is very incomplete and not currently maintained</li>
