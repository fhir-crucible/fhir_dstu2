The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organizations, and devices. Uses of communication request include 
	  <li>A computer-based decision-support system requesting a reminder or alert be delivered to a responsible provider</li>
	  <li>A physician requesting notification from the nurse if a patient's temperature exceeds a value</li>
	  <li>A monitoring system or a provider requesting a staff member or department to notify a public health agency of a patient presenting with a reportable communicable disease public health agency</li>
	  
	  As indicated above the request, may represent an order that entered by a practitioner in a CPOE 
        system as well as a proposal made by a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based 
        on a patient's clinical record and context of care.
