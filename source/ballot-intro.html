<h2>DSTU 2 Ballot Welcome</h2>
<p>
Hello and welcome to the second FHIR DSTU ballot!
</p>
<p>
This specification represents a series of significant changes and enhancements from the first FHIR Draft Standard for Trial Use
specification HL7 published in January, 2014.  It includes a number of new resources including support for claims and scheduling
as well as publish/subscribe and operations.  It also includes changes resulting from over 1500 change proposals submitted by
implementers and other readers of the specification.  A complete list of changes can be found <a href="history.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
While FHIR is not yet "normative", this specification is the product of many thousands of hours of development,
including several ballot cycles, multiple QA cycles, 8 Connectathons and production of a number of reference and proof of concept 
implementations.  Subsets of FHIR have been implemented or are currently being implemented on all continents other than Antarctica.
Therefore we hope that you find the specification already close to an implementable state.
</p>
<p>
The FHIR specification is presented as a series of interlinked HTML pages.  They can either be reviewed online or can be
<a href="fhir-spec.zip">downloaded</a> for exploration on your own device.  (70MB zip, 550MB unzipped).
 You can review whichever links are of interest in any 
order you wish.  However, to ensure a base level understanding of the specification we recommend that you click on the 
<a href="documentation.html">Documentation</a> link and read through at least the following:
</p>
<p>
For context:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview/<a href="summary.html">1 page Summary (Glossy)</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="overview-dev.html">Developer's Introduction</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="overview-clinical.html">Clinical Introduction</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="overview.html">Overview &amp; Roadmap</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="timelines.html">FHIR Timelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
To see scope:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the <a href="resourcelist.html">Resources</a> link at the top to get a sense of what resources exist and maybe drill into a couple of them to see what 
  they look like before coming back to the Documentation tab for more context</li>
</ul>
<p>
To understand base approach:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resources/<a href="resource.html">Base Resource</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="domainresource.html">DomainResource</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="narrative.html">Narrative</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="formats.html">Formats: XML, JSON</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="extensibility.html">Extensibility</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
To understand key infrastructure:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resources/<a href="datatypes.html">Data Types</a></li>
  <li>Terminologies/<a href="terminologies.html">Using Codes in Resources</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
For context for this ballot:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Administration/<a href="todo.html">Outstanding Issues</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Feel free to drill down into any other sections of interest.  If you want to ensure a complete review of the whole spec, the 
Documentation/Administration/<a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a> may be a useful guide.
</p>
<p>
A few notes to consider:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="draft"> </a>A few artifacts (generally resources) have been flagged as "draft".  This means that the work group authoring the content and/or
  the FHIR Management Group feels that the content is not yet sufficiently robust or complete for production use.  Implementers may
  choose to implement these artifacts anyhow, but should proceed with caution and may find that more adaptation or extension will be
  required than for a typical resource.  It is expected that "draft" resources will progress to DSTU as part of the next release.
  (Implementers may also want to check the <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/">Continuous Integration Build</a> for more up-to-date
  versions of these resources.)</li>
  <li>Not all of the outstanding issues will be resolved prior to the DSTU ballot passing.  Some may be left open to allow feedback 
  from the early adopter community.</li>
  <li>This specification is complete enough to be implementable in a variety of healthcare scenarios, including supporting all content 
  from the Consolidated CDA implementation guide.  However, the set of resources is not complete.  Resources may evolve and new ones 
  will be introduced over time.  Refer to <a href="timelines.html">FHIR Timelines</a> for additional guidance on expectations around
  the evolution of the FHIR specification.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Balloting</h3>
<p>
HL7 ballot rules require that participants sign up prior to opening of the ballot.  If you did not sign up in advance, please still
submit comments using the <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemAdd&amp;tracker_id=677">Propose a Change</a>
link at the bottom of each page of the specification.  Feedback from balloters will be given priority, but all suggestions will be
considered as much as time allows.  (And be sure to <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions">sign up</a> 
to the FHIR list-server and/or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fhir">#FHIR</a> hash-tag so you don't miss the chance to 
vote in the next ballot cycle.)
</p>
<p>
If you are signed up to ballot, you can download the balloting spreadsheet from the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/participate/onlineballoting.cfm">Ballot Desktop</a>.
All ballot feedback must be provided using the spreadsheet template provided.  (There's a help tab that explains the meaning of each of the columns.)
For FHIR, you have the option of making your comments directly in the spreadsheet or submitting your comment using the FHIR
<a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse">Change Tracker</a> tool.  If you take the latter approach, you <b>must</b> include a reference to each tracker item in your
ballot spreadsheet along with a vote (negative-major, affirmative typo, etc.).  All spreadsheets must be submitted along with an overall vote
by end of day Eastern time on the designated ballot closure date for the comments to be considered as part of ballot disposition.
</p>
<p>
Note: By using the tracker, you reduce some of the administrative effort of managing the ballot process.  As well, you will receive notifications
when comments are made on your ballot comment as well as when dispositions are made.  Comments not submitted to the tracker as part of the ballot
process will be migrated to the tracker after all ballot submissions are received.
</p>
<p>
When submitting your ballot feedback, if you have a general comment on something that you see occurring multiple times, please include 
at least a couple of specific locations where you see the issue.  As much as possible, capture each separate concern as a distinct row 
in the ballot sheet or separate <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse">tracker item</a>.  (If using tracker items for your submissions, you <b>MUST</b> still
submit a ballot spreadsheet referencing the relevant tracker items.)  It makes our job of reconciling much easier.  Also, don't forget to 
fill in the section numbers (gray numbers to the left of each heading) and URLs.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions that are interfering with the ability to review the specification or submit ballot comments, please contact one of 
the co-chairs of the FHIR Management Group: <a href="mailto:lloyd@lmckenzie.com">Lloyd McKenzie</a> or 
<a href="mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com">David Hay</a>.

Thanks for taking the time to review the FHIR specification.  We appreciate any feedback you can provide.
