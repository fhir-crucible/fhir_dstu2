<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<!-- PA original:
<p>

Ballot note: The Person resource does justice to Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless 
of their role. The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role
such as SubjectofCare (formerly Patient), Practitioner and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and
so Person is kept lean. Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the 
Person himself. Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Practitioner), 
and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare).
</p>
-->
<p>
  An individual has identity outside of a healthcare setting. The Person resource is used to capture this
  information and to relate the person as an individual to other resources that do have a health-related context.
</p>
  <p>
    For example, while a patient resource may be created and maintained by each organization providing care for
    that person as a patient, a person resource provides a mechanism for linking patient resources across 
    different organizations and their unique patient identity domains.

    This resource is not referenced by any other resources.
