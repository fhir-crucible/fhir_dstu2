<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The OperationDefinition resource provides a formal computable definition of an <a href="operations.html">operation</a> or <a href="search.html#advanced">a named query</a>.
The OperationDefinition serves two principal purposes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To allow for automatic determination of system compatibility</li>
 <li>To allow for dynamic generation of forms to drive the operations</li>
</ul>
<p>
See below for further information about these, and about how Operations and Named Queries are executed.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
Operation Definitions are published to define operations that servers can implement in a common fashion. 
The FHIR specification itself describes a number (see below), and other organizations, including 
IHE, national programs, jurisdictions and vendors are able to publish additional operation definitions.
</p>
<p>
OperationDefinition resources are referred to from two different places:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>From a <a href="conformance.html">Conformance Statement</a>, to declare what operations a system does or should implement</li>
 <li>From another OperationDefinition resource. This allows for a server to describe a limited implementation of a standard operation, or to allow traceability if the server has to rename the operation due to a name clash</li>
</ul>
