<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Reversal resource indicates the resource which is to be reversed and provides both supporting 
information for the reversal and whether the receiving system is permitted to retain a copy of the 
reversed resource.

</p>
<p>
The reversal is the formal request to cease processing an incomplete prior request or to reverse 
and/or nullify a complete prior request or information submission. When nullify=true then all copies 
of the original submission are to be purged, although audit logs may be retained. When Nullify=false 
a copy of the original request may be retained.
