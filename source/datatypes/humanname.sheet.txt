  Display = Official
  Definition = The formal name as registered in an official (government) registry, but which name might not be commonly used. May be called \"legal name\".
  v2 = ~0200.L
  v3 = =EntityNameUseR2.OR

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = temp
  Display = Temp
  Definition = A temporary name. Name.period can provide more detailed information. This may also be used for temporary names assigned at birth or in emergency situations.

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Id = 7
  Code = maiden
  Display = Maiden
  Definition = A name used prior to marriage. Marriage naming customs vary greatly around the world. This name use is for use by applications that collect and store \"maiden\" names. Though the concept of maiden name is often gender specific, the use of this term is not gender specific. The use of this term does not imply any particular history for a person\'s name, nor should the maiden name be determined algorithmically.

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = HumanName
  Type = Structure
  Short Label = Name of a human - parts and usage
  Definition = A human\'s name with the ability to identify parts and usage
  Requirements = Need to be able to record names, along with notes about their use
  Comments = Names may be changed, or repudiated, or people may have different names in different contexts. Names may be divided into parts of different type that have variable significance depending on context, though the division into parts does not always matter. With personal names, the different parts may or may not be imbued with some implicit meaning; various cultures associate different importance with the name parts and the degree to which systems must care about name parts around the world varies widely.
