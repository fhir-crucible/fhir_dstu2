<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DAFImmunization profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for immunizations belonging to a Patient</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have had a specific vaccine administered</li>
	<li>Query for immunizations administered based on lot number </li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Implementation Guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	<p><b>Representing No Known Immunizations:</b> No Known Immunizations will be represented using the DAFImmunization List with no entries and with an empty reason.</p>
	
	<p><b>Specifying Patients as part of the Immunization Queries:</b> DAF Immunization profile supports the querying the Immunizations for a particular patient. In order to achieve this in implementation, it is recommended to use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the allergies relevant to the patient. While other parameters such as  Patient.name, Patient.given could be used for the query, it could lead to incorrect Patient matching and/or inefficient queries when systems are not tuned. </p>
	
	<p><b>Patient Matching:</b> Patient Matching rules and criteria have to be evaluated by the implementing organization and have to comply with local policies and regulations. Query Requestors will have to deal with result sets that can return zero,one or more Immunization Resources in response to a query.</p>
	
	
</ul>
