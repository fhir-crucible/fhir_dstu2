  Short Label = Administration of medication to a patient
  Definition = Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a medication.  This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long running infusion.

  Type = Identifier
  Short Label = External identifier
  Definition = External identifier - FHIR will generate its own internal IDs (probably URLs) which do not need to be explicitly managed by the resource.  The identifier here is one that would be used by another non-FHIR system - for example an automated medication pump would provide a record each time it operated; an administration while the patient was off the ward might be made with a different system and entered after the event.  Particularly important if these records have to be updated.

  Short Label = What was administered?
  Definition = Identifies the medication that was administered. This is either a link to a resource representing the details of the medication or a simple attribute carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of medications.
  Comments = If only a code is specified, then it needs to be a code for a specific product.  If more information is required, then the use of the medication resource is recommended.  Note: do not use Medication.name to describe the administered medication. When the only available information is a text description of the medication, Medication.code.text should be used

  Element = MedicationAdministration.dosage.site[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept | Reference(BodySite)

 -- Row 19 -----------------------------------
  Element = MedicationAdministration.dosage.method
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = MedicationAdministrationMethod
  Short Label = How drug was administered
  Definition = A coded value indicating the method by which the medication is intended to be or was introduced into or on the body.  This attribute will most often NOT be populated.  It is most commonly used for injections.  Examples: Slow Push, Deep IV.  One of the reasons this attribute is not used often, is that the method is often pre-coordinated with the route and/or form of administration.  This means the codes used in route or form may pre-coordinate the method in the route code or the form code.  The implementation decision about what coding system to use for route or form code will determine how frequently the method code will be populated e.g. if route or form code pre-coordinate method code, then this attribute will not be populated often; if there is no pre-coordination then method code may  be used frequently.

 -- Row 20 -----------------------------------
  Element = MedicationAdministration.dosage.quantity
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = SimpleQuantity
  Short Label = Amount administered in one dose
  Definition = The amount of the medication given at one administration event.   Use this value when the administration is essentially an instantaneous event such as a swallowing a tablet or giving an injection.
  Comments = If the administration is not instantaneous (rate is present or timing has a duration), this can be specified to convey the total amount administered over period of time of a single administration (as indicated by schedule)
  v2 Mapping = RXA-6-Administered Amount / RXA-7.1-Administered Units.code / RXA-7.3-Administered Units.name of coding system (uri<->code system mapping required)
  RIM Mapping = doseQuantity

 -- Row 21 -----------------------------------
  Element = MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Ratio|Range
  Short Label = Dose quantity per unit of time
  Definition = Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into the patient.  Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.  Currently we do not specify a default of \'1\' in the denominator, but this is being discussed.  Other examples:  200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.
  Comments = If the rate changes over time, and you want to capture this in Medication Administration, then each change should be captured as a distinct Medication Administration, with a specific MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate, and the date time when the rate change occurred. Typically, the MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate element is not used to convey an average rate.
