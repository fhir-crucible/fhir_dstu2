<h3>Compartments</h3>
<p>
Each resource may belong to one or more logical compartments. A compartment is a logical 
grouping of resources which share a common property. Compartments have two principal roles:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Function as an access mechanism for finding a set of related resources quickly</li>
 <li>Provide a definitional basis for applying access control to resources quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>
Compartment definitions describe how particular compartment instances are named and identified,
and how systems know which resources are in the compartment. The following compartments are 
defined by this specification:
</p>
<%compartmentlist%>
<p>
Compartments are defined and added the list above when implementer 
communities identify them as common access points for data. As described 
below, compartments have both syntactical and logical consequences, and
both these aspects of their functionality are evaluated when deciding
whether to define compartments. 
</p>

<h3>Using Compartments</h3>

<p>
As an example of compartment usage, to retrieve a list of a patient's conditions, use the URL:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/Patient/[id]/Condition
</pre>
<p>
Additional search parameters can be defined, such as this hypothetical search for 
acute conditions:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/Patient/[id]/Condition?code:in=http://hspc.org/ValueSet/acute-concerns
</pre>
<p>
Note that as searches, these are syntactic variations on these two search
URLs respectively:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/Condition?patient=[id]
  GET [base]/Condition?patient=[id]&amp;code:in=http://hspc.org/ValueSet/acute-concerns
</pre>
<p>
However, there is a key difference in functionality between compartment based searches 
and direct searches with parameters. Consider this search:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/Patient/[id]/Communication
</pre>
<p>
Because the definition of the <a href="compartment-patient.html">patient compartment</a> for 
<a href="communication.html">Commnunication</a> says that aCommunication resource is in the 
patient compartment if the subject, sender, or recipient is the patient, the compartment
search is actually the same as the union of these 3 searches:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/Condition?subject=[id]
  GET [base]/Condition?sender=[id]
  GET [base]/Condition?recipient=[id]
</pre>
<p>
There is no way to do this as a single search, except by using the <a href="search_filter.html">_filter</a>:
</p>
<pre>
  GET [base]/Condition?_filter=subject re [id] or sender re [id] or recipient re [id]
</pre>
<p>
Further details of searching by compartment are <a href="http.html#vsearch">described under the search operation</a>.
As a search related operation, the assignment of resources to compartments is only based on 
the current version of any of the resources involved. Note that <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a>
patient resources cannot create a patient compartment of their own. 
</p>
<p>
Compartments may be used explicitly, like this, but can also be used implicitly. For instance,
if a FHIR server is providing a patient view of a record, the authorized user associated
with use of the FHIR RESTful API may be limited to accessing records from the
compartment instance(s) logically associated with their identity. Irrespective of whether
compartments are being used explicitly or implicitly, servers will need to make arrangements
to make some resources with no direct link to a patient available to the client (medications, 
substances, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Note that resources may cross between compartments, or interlink them. Examples of 
this would be where a <a href="diagnosticreport.html">Diagnostic Report</a> identifies  
a subject, but an <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> it references identifies
a different subject, or where a <a href="list.html">List</a> resource references
items that identify different subjects. Such cross-linking may arise for 
many valid reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cases where subject records are inter-linked - Transplants, Perinatal care, family therapy etc.</li>
 <li>Workflow management where action lists link multiple patients and/or practitioners</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given the wide variety of use cases and contexts in which FHIR is used, compartments 
do not define how cross-linking is handled. Systems may reject resources, remove them 
from both compartments, or place them in both, or act in some other fashion.
</p>
<p>
It is at the discretion of the server whether to include resources in a compartment when
the reference to the resource that establishes the compartment is in an extension.
</p>

<p>
Some resources are not in any compartment, e.g. <a href="medication.html">Medication</a>, 
<a href="substance.html">Substance</a>, <a href="location.html">Location</a>. These resources are not directly to a patient 
or authored record, and are some times called 'master files'. Servers will need to make 
arrangements to make these resources available to the clients that are limited to 
particular compartments. For example, a Medication resource describes a medication itself 
and does not link to a patient; however, a resource such as MedicationAdministration 
connects the Medication (details of what was administered) to the patient (for whom was 
it administered), and so is required to interpret the administration.
