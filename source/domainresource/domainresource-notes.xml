<h2>Search Parameters</h2>
<p>This resource doesn't define any common <a href="search.html">Search parameters</a></p>
<p>
To search for extensions, define a search parameter for the extension. 
All other search parameters are named aliases for existing content in
the resource. In some cases, though not all, the search parameter name
is the same as the element that it searches, but this is not required. 
Searching for extensions is the same - define a name that identifies 
the value extension by its URL, and then searches can filter based on
the value of the extension.
