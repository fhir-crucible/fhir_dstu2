<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The Resource SHALL NOT be used for persons involved without a formal responsibility like individuals taking care for friends, 
relatives or neighbors. These can be registered as a Patient's Contact.  If performing some action or being referenced by another
resource, use the <a href="relatedperson.html">RelatedPerson</a> resource.
</p>
<p>
	The primary distinction between a Practitioner and a RelatedPerson is based on whether:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	The person/animal operates on behalf of the care delivery organization over multiple patients (Practitioner) or,
</li>
<li>
	Where the person/animal is not associated with the organization, and instead is
	allocated tasks specifically for the RelatedPerson's Patient (RelatedPerson).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	A standard extension <a href="extension-practitioner-animalspecies.html">animalSpecies</a> can be used to indicate the species of a service animal.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, 
it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each such role or have a single Practitioner with multiple roles.
The role can be limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends. Note that the represented organization
need not necessarily be the (direct) employer of a Practitioner.
