 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Organization.identifier
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = Y
  Inv. = 1
  Type = Identifier
  Short Label = Identifies this organization  across multiple systems
  Definition = Identifier for the organization that is used to identify the organization across multiple disparate systems
  Requirements = Organizations are known by a variety of ids. Some institutions maintain several, and most collect identifiers for exchange with other organizations concerning the organization.

  RIM Mapping = .status
  ServD Mapping = ./Status (however this concept in ServD more covers why the organization is active or not, could be delisted, deregistered, not operational yet) this could alternatively be derived from ./StartDate and ./EndDate and given a context date.
  Committee Notes = Lloyd(?): This isn\'t data we record about an organization but is data about this organization\'s record. I would argue about including this metadata here. It also implies effects on functionality, like not showing up in queries anymore, which cannot be guaranteed. All in all, this belongs to record infrastructure, not data. Status of Organization is different type to Location as the status of a Location is not always binary, as it can be on hold, whereas for the Organizations either they are active or not.

  Requirements = Need to be able to track the kind of organization that this is - different organization types have different uses
  Comments = Organizations can be corporations, wards, sections, clinical teams, government departments, etc. Note that code is generally a classifier of the type of organization; in many applications, codes are used to identity a particular organization (say, ward) as opposed to another of the same type - these are identifiers, not codes

  Type = ContactPoint
  Short Label = A contact detail for the organization

  Requirements = For many organizations in healthcare, it is necessary to track the qualifications an organization has
  v2 Mapping = Roughly analogous to person-specific CER segment in V2.x
  RIM Mapping = .plays[Role](classCode=\'QUAL\')
  ServD Mapping = Could be mapped via ./Attrbutes or ./Affiliations
  To Do = 1) Not sure if qualified & accredited are the same.  2) Could potentially propose a new classCode. We wonder if Accreditation is in the 80%. Accreditation is not part of the current PA domain, it was in Personnel Management but this has been retracted. The PM version also had many more attributes, so is this Accreditation good enough? We (current participants) do not use it. We decide to keep it, to see what happens in ballot

  Requirements = May determine the significance of the qualification, and allows a link back to a qualification registry, if one exists

  To Do = Lloyd(?): Do we need jurisdiction as well?  (The jurisdiction is often more relevant than the accrediting org.)  EK: Isn\'t a jurisdiction an organization?
