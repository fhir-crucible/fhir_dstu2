<h3>Security Claim Types</h3>

<p>
For further information concerning security claims, see <a href="securityclaimtype.html">Security Claim Types</a>.
This resource defines two search parameters for claims, "type" and "claim". <i>type</i> is a uri search that searches for 
any security principal resources with claims of a partocular type, but a URL. <i>claim</i> is a token search that searches
both "type" and "claim" - if the token includes a namespace, portion, then the namespace portion relates to the 
security type (e.g. the "type" and "claim" correspond to "system" and "code" from a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a>
data type for searching purposes).
</p>
<p>
The claims function as a Set - that is, the full set of claims for a principal is the union of the claims made
for the principal itself, and those made for all the principal's groups.
