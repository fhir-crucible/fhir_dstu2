<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<a name="use"> </a>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>The group resource is used in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To define a group of specific people, animals, devices, etc. that is being tracked, examined or otherwise referenced as part of healthcare-related activities</li>
  <li>To define a set of *possible* people, animals, devices, etc. that are of interest for some intended future healthcare-related activities</li>
</ol>

<p>Examples of the former could include group therapy or treatment sessions, exposed entities tracked as part of public health, etc.  The latter might be used to define expected subjects for a clinical study.</p>

<p>Both use cases are handled by a single resource because the data elements captured tend to be similar.</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
There are five mechanisms in FHIR for communicating collections of resources:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="list.html">List</a> resource - enumerates a flat collection of resources and provides features for managing the collection.  
While a particular List instance may represent a "snapshot", from a business process perspective the notion of "List" 
is dynamic – items are added and removed over time.  The list resource references other resources.  Lists may be 
curated and have specific business meaning.
</li>
<li>
This Group resource - defines a group of specific people, animals, devices, etc. by enumerating them, 
or by describing qualities that group members have. The group resource refers to other resources, possibly implicitly.  
Groups are intended to be acted upon or observed as a whole.  E.g. performing therapy on a group, calculating risk for a group, 
etc.  This resource will commonly be used for public health (e.g. describing an at-risk population), clinical trials (e.g. 
defining a test subject pool) and similar purposes.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a> resource is an infrastructure container for a group of resources.  It does not have narrative 
and is used to group collections of resources for transmission, persistence or processing (e.g. messages, documents, transactions, 
query responses, etc.)  The content of bundles is typically algorithmically determined for a particular exchange or persistence purpose.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="composition.html">Composition</a> resource – defines a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled 
together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and 
that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. The composition resource provides the basic structure 
of a FHIR <a href="documents.html">document</a>.  The full content of the document is expressed using a bundle.  Compositions will 
often reference Lists as the focus of particular sections.
</li>
</ul>
