<h2>Implementation Guides defined as part of FHIR</h2>
 
<p>
An Implementation Guide is a collection of <a href="profile.html">Profiles</a>, <a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a>
requirements, <a href="valueset.html">ValueSets</a> and other resources, together with textual guidance, that provides instruction
on how to make use of FHIR in a particular problem space.  Implementation guides may be developed and published as part of
a FHIR release or as separate specifications.  Additional support and tooling for implementation guides is being developed, so
the content provided here should be considered "preliminary" from a publication perspective.
</p>
<p>
At present, implementation guides are published in conjunction with the FHIR specification because tooling that supports
straightforward independent publication is not yet developed.  However, the intention is that in the future implementation guides
will be published separately from the core FHIR specification and can be subject to separate approval processes.
</p>
<p>
The predominance of US implementation guides in this specification is a result of the fact that the US doesn't have an independent
affiliate body to support balloting and publishing of US realm-specific content.  It should in no way be interpreted as suggesting
that FHIR is a US-centric specification.
