
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = SignatureType
  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-signature-type
  Definition = An indication of the reason that an entity signed the object
  Conformance = preferred
  Oid = 1.2.840.10065.1.12

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Signature
  Type = Type
  Short Label = A digital Signature - XML DigSig, JWT, Graphical image of signature, etc
  Definition = A digital signature along with supporting context. The signature may be electronic/cryptographic in nature, or a graphical image representing a hand-written signature, or a signature process. Different Signature approaches have different utilities
  Requirements = There are a number of places where content must be signed in healthcare
  Comments = The elements of the Signature Resource are for ease of access of these elements. Foro digital signatures (Xml DigSig, JWT), the non-repudiation proof comes from the Signature  validation, which includes validation of the referenced objects (e.g., Resources) (a.k.a., Content) in the XML-Signature Detached form.
  To Do = application/signature+xml

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Signature.type
  Card. = 1..*
  Type = Coding
  Binding = SignatureType
  Short Label = Indication of the reason the entity signed the object(s)
  Definition = An indication of the reason that the entity signed this document. This may be explicitly included as part of the signature information and can be used when determining accountability for various actions concerning the document.
  Comments = Examples include attesting to: authorship, correct transcription, and witness of specific event. Also known as a “Commitment Type Indication”

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Signature.when
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = instant
  Short Label = When the signature was created
  Definition = When the digital signature was signed.
  Comments = This should agree with the information in the signature

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Signature.who[x]
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = uri|Reference(Practitioner|RelatedPerson|Patient|Device|Organization)
  Short Label = Who signed the signature
  Definition = A reference to an application-usable description of the person that signed the certificate (e.g. the signature used their private key)
  Comments = This should agree with the information in the signature

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = Signature.contentType
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = code
  Binding = MimeType
  Short Label = The technical format of the signature
  Definition = A mime type that indicates the technical format of the signature. Important mime types are application/signature+xml for X ML DigSig, application/jwt for JWT, and image/* for a graphical image of a signature

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Signature.blob
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = base64Binary
  Short Label = The actual signature content (XML DigSig. JWT, picture, etc)
  Definition = The base64 encoding of the Signature content
  Comments = Where the signature type is an XML DigSig, the signed content is a FHIR Resource(s), the signature is of the XML form of the Resource(s) using  XML-Signature (XMLDIG) \"Detached Signature\" form.
