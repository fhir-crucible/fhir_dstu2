<p>
Many of the defined elements in a resource are references to other resources. Using these
references, the resources combine to build a web of information about healthcare.
</p>
<p>
Resources contain two types of references:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Internal "contained" references</b> - references to other resources packaged inside the source resource</li>
 <li><b>External references</b> - references to resources found elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>
References are always defined and represented in one particular direction - from one resource (source) to another (target).
References are provided as a URL, which may either be absolute or relative. Resolving the references is discussed below.
</p>
<p>
The corresponding reverse relationship from the target to the source exists in a logical sense, but is
not represented explicitly in the resource. For external references, navigating these reverse relationships requires some
external infrastructure to track the relationship between resources (the <a href="http.html">REST API</a> provides one such
infrastructure by providing the ability to <a href="http.html#search">search</a> the reverse relationship by naming
search parameters for the references, and by providing support for <a href="search.html#revinclude">reverse includes</a>).
</p>
<p>
Because resources are processed independently, relationships are not considered to be transitive.
For example, if a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource references a particular
<a href="patient.html">Patient</a> as its subject, and references a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>
resource as its cause, there is no automatic rule or implication that the procedure
has the same patient for its subject. Instead, the subject of the procedure must be established
directly in the procedure itself. Another way to state this is that the context of the subject
is not "inherited", nor does it "conduct" along the relationship to procedure.
The only exception to this is the case of contained resources (see below). Note that in
practice, the relationships do need to describe a logical and coherent record, and in the
case of the Condition and Procedure described here, they would usually be required to have
the same patient for their subjects.
</p>

<p>
In a resource, references are represented with a reference and a text description.
The <i>reference</i> is the key element - resources are identified and addressed by their URL.
The actual reference looks like this:
</p>

[%dt Reference 1%]

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="use">
<p><b>Constraints</b></p>
<p>
[%dt.constraints Reference%]
</p>

</div>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <i>reference</i> element contains a url that is either
   <ul>
     <li>an absolute URL</li>
     <li>a relative URL, which is relative to the <a href="http.html#root">Service Base URL</a>, or, in a bundle the <code>Bundle.entry.fullUrl</code> (see <a href="bundle.html#references">Resolving References in Bundles</a></li>
     <li>an internal fragment reference (see "Contained Resources" below)</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <a name="regex"> </a>
 <li>Using absolute URLs provides a stable scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a
   flexible approach suitable for use when trading across closed ecosystem boundaries. (see <a href="implementation.html#identity">implementation issues for further discussion</a>)</li>
 <li>Absolute URLs do not need to point to a <a href="http.html">FHIR RESTful server</a>, though this is the preferred approach.
   Whether or not the reference is to a FHIR RESTful server, the reference SHALL point to a Resource as defined by this specification. 
   <br/>Note: This regex is true if the reference to a resource is consistent with a FHIR API:
   <pre>
   ((http|https)://([A-Za-z0-9\\\/\.\:\%\$])*)?([%piperesources%])\/[%id_regex%](\/_history\/[%id_regex%])?
   </pre>
   <br/>
   However conformance with this regex is no guarantee that the end point is a FHIR server
   </li>
 <li>URLs are always considered to be case-sensitive</li>
 <li>The <i>display</i>, if populated, does generally not have identical content to the Resource.text of the referenced resource.  The purpose is to
   identify what's being referenced, not to more fully describe it</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p>A relative reference to the <a href="patient.html">patient</a> "034AB16" in an element named "context" on a FHIR RESTful server:</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;context&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Patient/034AB16" /&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;
</pre>
<p>An absolute reference to a <a href="structuredefinition.html">Structure Definition</a> in an element named "profile":</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;profile&gt;
    &lt;reference value="http://fhir.hl7.org/svc/StructureDefinition/c8973a22-2b5b-4e76-9c66-00639c99e61b" /&gt;
  &lt;/profile&gt;
</pre>
<p><i>Note that HL7 has not yet actually created a profile registry, nor decided on a URL for it</i>.</p>
<p>
A short display text that provides a human-readable identification of the resource may be provided:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Reference">
  &lt;custodian&gt;
    &lt;reference value="Organization/123" /&gt;
    &lt;display value="HL7, Inc" /&gt;
  &lt;/custodian&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This text can be used by a system that is unable to resolve the reference to an actual resource.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note that some elements have the type "<a href="datatypes.html#uri">uri</a>" instead of "Reference".
URIs may point to either resources, elements inside a resource by their "id" property, or (most often)
some other content that is not a resource. The Reference type is only used to refer to resources
directly, by their logical id.
</p>

<a name="contained"> </a>
<h3>Contained Resources</h3>
<p>
In some circumstances, the content referred to in the resource reference does not have an independent
existence apart from the resource that contains it - it cannot be identified independently, and nor
can it have its own independent transaction scope. Typically, such circumstances arise where resources
are being assembled by a secondary user of the source data, such as a middleware engine. If the data available
when the resource is constructed does not include record keys or absolute identification information, then
a properly identified resource cannot be assembled, and even if an arbitrary identification was associated
with it, the resource could never be the subject of a transaction outside the context of the resource that
refers to it.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a situation where an interface engine is creating a <a href="condition.html">Condition</a>
record on a patient from an HL7 v2 message, and the only information about the primary surgeon is her
first name and lastname (REL-7.2 &amp; RES-7.3). In the absence of a controlled practitioner directory,
this is not enough information to create an identified <a href="practitioner.html">Practitioner</a>
resource - more than one practitioner might have the same name.
</p>
<p>
In these circumstances, the resource is placed directly in line in the resource. <b>This SHOULD NOT be
done when the content can be identified properly, as once the identification is lost, it is extremely difficult
(and context dependent) to restore it again.</b>
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
An example of a contained resource:
</p>
<pre class="xml"> <!-- Can't fragment test this - too incomplete -->
 &lt;Composition xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir"&gt;
  &lt;extension&gt;...&lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;...&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;contained&gt;
    &lt;Organization&gt;
      &lt;id value=&quot;org1&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;!-- whatever information is available --&gt;
    &lt;/Organization&gt;
  &lt;/contained&gt;
  &lt;information&gt;
    &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
    &lt;custodian&gt;
      &lt;reference value="#org1" /&gt;
    &lt;/custodian&gt;
    &lt;!-- other attributes --&gt;
  &lt;information&gt;
 &lt;/Composition&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The same example in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json">
{ "resourceType" : "Composition",
  "extension" : { ... },
  "text" : { .. },
  "contained: [
    {
      "resourceType" : "Organization",
      "id" : "org1",
      .. whatever information is available ...
	}  ]
  "information: {
    ... other attributes ...
    "custodian" : {
      "reference" : "#org1"
	}
    ... other attributes ...
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<div class="design-note">
<p>
Design Note: Contained resources are still a reference rather than being inlined directly
into the element that is the reference (e.g. "custodian" above) to ensure that a
single approach to resolving resource references can be used. Though direct containment
would seem simpler, it would still be necessary to support internal references where the
same contained resource is referenced more than once. In the end, all that it would achieve
is creating additional options in the syntax. For users using XPath to process the resource,
the following XPath fragment resolves the internal reference:
</p>
<pre>
ancestor::f:*[not(parent::f:*)]/f:contained/*[@id=substring-after(<b>current()</b>/f:reference/@value, '#')]
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Some notes about use and interpretation of contained resources:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The "contained" element SHALL NOT have extensions on it (though contained resources can still contain extensions)</li>
  <li>Contained resources share the same internal id resolution space as the parent resource (for id attributes, see below)</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHALL NOT contain additional contained resources</li>
  <li>Contained resources SHALL NOT contain any narrative</li>
  <li>A contained resource SHALL only be included in a resource if something that resource has a reference to it</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resources that are contained inline do not "inherit" context from their parent resource. For instance, if
the parent resource contains a "subject", and the contained resource also has a "subject" element defined,
there is no implication that the contained resource has the same subject as the parent resource.
</p>
    
<p>
Resources can only be contained in other resources if there is a reference from the resource to 
the contained resource. This is intended to ensure that the meaning of the contained resource
is clear, and that there is no confusion as to its significance.

<b>DSTU Note:</b> There are some identified use cases where it would be useful to include resources that refer
to the contained resource rather than the container referring to the contained resource, but this 
has a series of structural ramifications for the API. Whether these can be resolved is an open 
issue for investigation during the period of trial use.
