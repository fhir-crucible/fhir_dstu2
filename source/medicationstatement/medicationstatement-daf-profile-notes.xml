<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DAFMedicationStatement profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for active medications being taken by a patient</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who are taking a particular medication</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who are/were taking a particular medication within a particular time period</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Implementation Guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	
	<p><b>Representing No Known Medications:</b> No Known Medications will be represented using the DAFMedicationStatement List with no entries and with an empty reason.</p>
	
	<p><b>Specifying Patients as part of the MedicationStatement Queries:</b> DAFMedicationStatement profile supports querying the medications for a particular patient. In order to achieve this in implementation, it is recommended to use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the medications relevant to the patient. While other parameters such as  Patient.name, Patient.given could be used for the query, it could lead to incorrect Patient matching and/or inefficient queries when systems are not tuned. </p>
	
	<p><b>Patient Matching:</b> Patient Matching rules and criteria have to be evaluated by the implementing organization and have to comply with local policies and regulations. Query Requestors will have to deal with result sets that can return zero,one or more MedicationStatement Resources in response to a query.</p>
	
</ul>
