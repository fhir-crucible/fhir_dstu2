The XML representation for a resource is described using this format: 
</p>
<pre class="spec">
 &lt;<b>name</b> xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir" (attrA="value")&gt;   <span style="float: right"><a title="Documentation for this format" href="xml.html"><img src="help.png" alt="doco"/></a></span>

   &lt;<b>nameC</b>&gt; <font color="Brown"><font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font> <b>1..*</b> --&gt;</font>
     &lt;<b>nameD</b>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font><font color="brown">1..1</font> <font color="darkgreen">type</font>&gt;<font color="navy">Relevant elements</font> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;/nameD&gt;
   &lt;/nameC&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Using this format:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To build a valid XML instance of a resource, simply replace the contents of the elements and attributes with valid content 
   as described by the cardinality, type rules and content description found in the comment in each element</li>
 <li>Resource and Element names are case-sensitive (though duplicates that differ only in case are never defined)</li>
 <li>Elements must always appear in the order documented</li>
 <li>When an element is allowed to repeat, the elements are ordered, and implementations must preserve order (note: the meaning of the order may not be known)</li>
 <li>A few properties are represented as attributes: primitive values in the "value" attribute, extension URLs in the "url" attribute on an extension, and the "id" property</li>
 <li>Any of the XML elements may have an id attribute to serve as <a href="references.html#id">the target of an internal reference</a>. The id attribute is not shown in this format</li>
 <li>FHIR elements are always in the namespace <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>.  This is usually specified as the default namespace on the root element. 
   The only other namespace that occurs in FHIR resources is the XHTML namespace (<a href="narrative.html">XHTML is found in most resources)</a></li>
 <li>Infrastructural elements that are common to all resources are not shown in the xml representation. These must appear prior to any other defined child elements in the following order:
	<ul>
		<li>First, the elements from the <a href="resource.html">base resource</a>, in order</li>
		<li>Second, the elements from the <a href="domainresource.html">domain resource</a>, in order</li>
	</ul>
 </li>
 <li>FHIR elements are never empty. If an element is present in the resource, it SHALL have either a value attribute, child elements as defined for its type, or 1 or more <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a></li>
 <li>Attributes can never be empty. Either they are absent, or they are present with at least one character of non-whitespace content</li>
 <li>Implementers SHOULD trim leading and trailing whitespace before writing and SHOULD trim leading and trailing whitespace when reading attribute values</li>
 <li>The lock icon (<img alt="??" src="lock.png"/>) denotes that an element defines or is affected by <a href="conformance-rules.html#constraints">additional rules</a> that control its presence and/or content</li>
 <li>XML comments, processing instructions and formatting are not part of the contents of a resource</li>
 <li>XML resources SHALL be exchanged using UTF-8 encoding. Specifying the character encoding using a &lt;?xml encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt; processing instruction is optional but recommended</li>
 <li>Other processing instructions SHOULD not be included, and SHALL NOT be required in order to properly understand and/or present the data or narrative of the resource. 
  Applications MAY preserve processing instructions when handling resources, but are not required to do so</li>
 <li>The MIME-type for this format is application/xml+fhir.</li>
</ul>

<h3>XML Schema and Schematron</h3>
<p>
This specification provides schema definitions for all of the content models it describes. 
</p>
<p>
The base schema is called "<a href="fhir-base.xsd">fhir-base.xsd</a>" and defines all of the 
datatypes and base infrastructure types. In addition, there 
is a schema for each resource and a common schema <a href="fhir-all.xsd">fhir-all.xsd</a> 
that includes all the resource schemas. For schema processors that do not like circular
includes, there is <a href="fhir-single.xsd">a single schema</a> that contains everything.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the w3c schema files, this specification also provides Schematron files that
enforce the various constraints defined for the datatypes and resources.  These are packaged
as files for each resource.
</p>
<p>
XML that is exchanged SHALL be valid against the w3c schema and Schematron, though being 
valid against the schema and Schematron is not sufficient to be a conformant instance: 
this specification makes several rules that cannot be checked by either mechanism. 
Operational systems may choose to use schema tools to check validation, but are not 
required to do so. Exchanged content SHALL NOT specify the schema or even contain the schema 
instance namespace in the resource itself. 
</p>
<p>
Given the way <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a> work, applications reading
XML resources will never enocunter unknown elements. However once an application 
starts trading with other appplications that conform to later versions of this specification,
unknown XML elements may be encountered. Applications MAY choose to ignore unknown elements
in order to foster forwards compatibility in this regard, but may also choose not to - which 
would be the normal behaviour for schema generated applications. Applications declare 
their behaviour with regard to unknown elements using <a href="conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.acceptUnknown">Conformance.acceptUnknown</a>.
</p>

<a name="schema-gen"> </a>
<h3>Code Generation Schema</h3>

<p>
In addition to the validation schema, this specification provides a
set of schema suitable for code generation usage. These schema describe
the same XML syntax, but apply less validation in order to create a 
schema that works with more code generation frameworks. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, these schemas are generated without any xs:choice elements, 
for code generators that don't deal with choices well. Implementers that 
use these schemas will need to enforce the correct usage of the 
<a href="formats.html#choice">choice elements</a> without schema
support.
</p>
<p>
Implementers making use of schema driven code generation tooling need
to consider how to handle the <a href="datatypes.html#decimal">decimal</a>
data type. The decimal data type is defined to be precision aware - that 
is, that implementers need to preserve the difference between "2.0" and
"2.00" - this is ubiquitiously considered important in handling observed
data in healthcare. Both schemas map this data type to xsd:decimal, but
the base <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#decimal">W3C schema decimal type</a> is specified not to be precision aware. Schema
driven implementations vary as to how precision is handled, and implementers
will need to determine how their generated code handles decimals, and 
consider changing the type for decimal in the schema from xsd:decimal
to xsd:string. Specifically, implementers may wish to change 
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;decimal-primitive&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:decimal&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;-?([0]|([1-9][0-9]*))(\.[0-9]+)?&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
</pre>
<p>
to this:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;decimal-primitive&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;-?([0]|([1-9][0-9]*))(\.[0-9]+)?&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
  &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, if supported, implementers may wish to use the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsd-precisionDecimal/">precisionDecimal</a> from the XSD 1.1 framework.
</p>
<p>
Note that most code generation frameworks ignore the pattern restriction.

<h3>Canonical XML</h3>
<p>
Resources and/or Bundles may be digitally signed (see <a href="bundle.html">Bundle</a> and <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a>). 
</p>
<p>
This specification defines the following method for canonicalizing FHIR resources, when represented as 
xml:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>No whitespace other than single spaces in attribute values and in the xhtml in the <a href="narrative.html">Narrative</a></li>
 <li>Use default namespaces for the FHIR and XHTML namespaces</li>
 <li>Omit all elements that have a default value, if a default value is defined</li>
 <li>Omit all comments</li>
 <li>Always use the unicode character representation for any XML entities (e.g. &amp;#39; instead of &amp;quot;)</li>
 <li>Include the XML processing instruction &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</li>
 <li>Using the XML canonical method <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/#sec-Canonical">Canonical XML 1.1</a> (<code>http://www.w3.org/2006/12/xml-c14n11</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This canonicalization method is identified by the URL <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml</code>. The 
following additional canonicalization URLS are also defined:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
  <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml#data</td>
  <td>The narrative (<code>Resource.text</code>) is omitted prior to signing (note the deletion is at <code>Resource.text</code>, not <code>Resource.text.div</code>)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml#static</td>
  <td>In addition to narrative (Resource.text), the <code>Resource.meta</code> element is removed. This makes the signature robust as the content is moved from server to server, or workflow and access tags are added or removed</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>http://hl7.org/fhir/canonicalization/xml#narrative</td>
  <td>The method only covers the <code>Resource.id</code> and Narrative is retained</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
These canonicalization methods allow system the flexiibility to sign the various portions of 
the resource that matter for the workflow the signature serves.
</p>

<p>
Note: One consequence of signing the document is that URLs, identifiers and internal references are frozen and 
cannot be changed. This might be a desired feature, but it may also cripple interoperability between closed 
ecosystems where <a href="managing.html">re-identification</a> frequently occurs. For this reason, it is 
recommended that systems consider carefully the impact of any signature processes. The impact of signatures
on <a href="documents.html">Document bundles</a> and their related processes is the most well understood
use of digital signatures.
