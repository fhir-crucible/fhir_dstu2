<h3>Default Profiles</h3>
<p>
An implementation guide can define default profiles - these are profiles that apply to any resource that
does not otherwise have an explicit profile assigned by the implementation guide. Default profiles 
are always references to profiles (<a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a> resources)
that are also contained in the resources. By defining default profiles, an implementation guide
can save itself from exhaustively defining profiles on every resource type just to profile every
reference to a particular resource type. 
</p>
<p>
Note that a resource can conform to the default profile by conforming to any profile derived from it.
