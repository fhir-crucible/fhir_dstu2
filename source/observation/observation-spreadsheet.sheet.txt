Comments: Indirect characteristics may be those of a specimen, fetus, donor,  other observer (for example a relative or EMT), or any observation made about the subject.
  Requirements = Observations have no value if you don\'t know who or what they\'re about.
  Comments = One would expect this element to be a cardinality  of 1..1.  The only circumstance in which the subject can be missing is when the observation is made by a device that does not know the patient. In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated.\r\rIf the target of the observation is different than the subject, the general extension [observation-focal-subject](extension-observation-focal-subject.html).  may be used.  However, the distinction between the patient\'s own value for an observation versus that of the fetus, or the donor or blood product unit, etc., are often specified in the observation code.

  Type = Quantity|CodeableConcept|string|Range|Ratio|SampledData|Attachment|time|dateTime|Period
  Short Label = Actual result
  Definition = The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value
  Requirements = An observation exists to have a value, though it may not if it is in error, or it represents a group of observations
  Comments = Normally, an observation will have either a value or a set of related observations. A few observations (e.g. apgar store) may have both a value and related observations (for an apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. This element has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueString, valueRange, valueRatio, valueSampledData, valueAttachment, valueTime, valueDateTime, or valuePeriod. (The name format is \"\'value\' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).\r\r\rIf the data element is usually coded or if the type associated with the Observation.value defines a coded value, use CodeableConcept instead of string datatype even if the value is uncoded text.  A value set is bound to the ValueCodeableConcept element.  For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from [HL7 Version 2 Table 0136](v2/0136/index.html). These \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed.   For further discussion and examples see the  [notes section](observation.html#4.20.4) below.

  Definition = Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.
  Requirements = For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.
  Comments = Null or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"specimen unsatisfactory\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.

  Comments = Note that in most contexts, unreliable results are not recorded, deleted, or otherwise excluded, but it\'s not always possible to exclude them from the record.  If the reliability indicator is present, interpreters of a result, whether human or machine, should always either be aware of the status or prevented from using the observation without being unaware that the reliability is not \"ok\".

  Type = Quantity|CodeableConcept|string|Range|Ratio|SampledData|Attachment|time|dateTime|Period
  Short Label = Actual component result
  Definition = The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value
  Requirements = An observation exists to have a value, though it may not if it is in error, or it represents a group of observations
  Comments = Normally, an observation will have either a value or a set of related observations. A few observations (e.g. apgar store) may have both a value and related observations (for an apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value.   For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from <http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136> (These \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed\").  The element, Observation.value[x], has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueRatio, valueChoice, valuePeriod, valueSampleData, or valueString (The name format is \"\'value\' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).

  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = ObservationValueAbsentReason
  Short Label = Why the component result is missing
  Definition = Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.
  Requirements = For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.
  Comments = \"Null\" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"test not done\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.

  Element = Observation.component.referenceRange
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = @Observation.referenceRange
  Short Label = Provides guide for interpretation ofcomponent result
  Definition = Guidance on how to interpret the value by comparison to a normal or recommended range
  Requirements = Knowing what values are considered \"normal\" can help evaluate the significance of a particular result. Need to be able to provide multiple reference ranges for different contexts
  Comments = Most observations only have one generic reference range. Systems MAY choose to restrict to only supplying the relevant reference range based on knowledge about the patient (e.g. specific to the patient\'s age, gender, weight and other factors), but this may not be possible or appropriate. Whenever more than one reference range is supplied, the differences between them SHOULD be provided in the reference range and/or age properties
