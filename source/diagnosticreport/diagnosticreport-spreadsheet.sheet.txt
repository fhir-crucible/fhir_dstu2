  Definition = The findings and interpretation of diagnostic  tests performed on patients, groups of patients, devices, and locations, and/or specimens derived from these. The report includes clinical context such as requesting and provider information, and some mix of atomic results, images, textual and coded interpretation, and formatted representation of diagnostic reports.
  Requirements = To support reporting for any diagnostic report into a clinical data repository.
  Comments = This is intended to capture a single report, and is not suitable for use in displaying summary information that covers multiple reports.  For example, this resource has not been designed for laboratory cumulative reporting formats nor detailed structured reports for sequencing.

  Definition = The time or time-period the observed values are related to. When the subject of the report is a patient, this is usually either the time of the procedure or of specimen collection(s), but very often the source of the date/time is not known, only the date/time itself.
  Requirements = Need to know where in the patient history to file/present this report
  Comments = If the diagnostic procedure was performed on the patient, this is the time it was performed. If there are specimens, the diagnostically relevant time can be derived from the specimen collection times, but the specimen information is not always available, and the exact relationship between the specimens and the diagnostically relevant time is not always automatic.

  Requirements = Need to be able to individual results, or report groups of results, where the result grouping is arbitrary, but meaningful. This structure is recursive - observations can contain observations

  Definition = One or more links to full details of any imaging performed during the diagnostic investigation. Typically, this is imaging performed by DICOM enabled modalities, but this is not required. A fully enabled PACS viewer can use this information to provide views of the source images.
  Comments = dImagingStudy and ImageObjectStudy and the image element are somewhat overlapping - typically, the list of image references in the image element will also be found in one of the imaging study resources. However each caters to different types of displays for different types of purposes. Neither, either, or both may be provided.

  Requirements = The provider of the report should make a comment about each image included in the report.
  Comments = The comment should be displayed with the image. It would be common for the report to include additional discussion of the image contents in other sections such as the conclusion.

  Short Label = Clinical Interpretation of test results
  Definition = Concise and clinically contextualized narrative interpretation of the diagnostic report
  Requirements = Need to be able to provide a conclusion that is not lost amongst the basic result data
  Comments = Typically, a report is either [all data, no narrative (e.g. Core lab)] or [a mix of data with some concluding narrative (e.g. Structured Pathology Report, Bone Density)], or [all narrative (e.g. typical imaging report, histopathology)]. In all of these cases, the narrative goes in \"text\".
