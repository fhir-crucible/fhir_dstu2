<p>
This page provides a quick overview of how the FHIR specification supports 
validation of resources. 
</p>

<p>
In principle, resources can be validated:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Against the original specification</li>
 <li>Against an implementation guide</li>
 <li>Against a specific profile</li>
</ul>

<p>
Resources can be tested for conformance by:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="#schema">Using the XML Schema</a> - for XML instances only</li>
 <li><a href="#jar">Using the FHIR Validator</a> - a java jar provided as part of the specification</li>
 <li><a href="#op">Asking a FHIR Server</a> - using the $validate operation</li>
 <li><a href="#web">Via a web interface</a> - using a web form on a test server</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that all these validation methods are incomplete; they 
can only validate the computable aspects of conformance, but there are always 
additional rules made in narrative that they are not able to check (e.g. a rule 
such as "All the clinically important content in the data SHALL be in the 
narrative", which might be made in an implementation guide, but could never be checked 
by a conformance tool).
</p>
<p>
In case of disagreement between these conformance methods, note that:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The schema/schematron is the least capable - mainly because it is not connected to a terminology server</li>
 <li>The java validator is only as good as the underlying definitions, and in particular depends on whether the underlying terminology server supports all the relevant terminologies</li>
 <li>In general, the server validation operations use or derive from the java validation code, so have the same caveats</li>
 <li>The final arbiter is human inspection of the content of the resources, and the relevant implementation guides and base specification</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, note that static testing of resource content is not enough to
prove conformance to the specification. For further information, see
<a href="http://fhir.org/conformance-testing">FHIR Conformance Testing</a>.
</p>

<a name="schema"> </a>
<h3>Using the XML schema</h3>

<p>
The XML schema can be used to validate XML represenations of the resources. 
When validating a resource, you can nominate one of the following schema: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>fhir-all.xsd: links in all the individual modular schemas</li>
 <li>fhir-single.xsd: a single large file, mainly provided for schema processors that can't support circular references</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the validation schema includes schematron
that can be initiated with transform "iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl" included in the 
<a href="downloads.html#refimpl">XML Tools</a> download. Note that 
XSLT2 is required to run the schematrons. 
</p>
<p>
When running the schematron, use the file "fhir-invariants.sch". This
includes all the schematrons. The individual schematron files for each
resource are provided to allow implementers to build their own smaller
combined file that covers the relevant resource types for them.
</p>

<h3>Using the FHIR Validator</h3>

<p>
The FHIR Validator is a Java jar that is provided as part of the specification, and that is used 
during the publication process to validate that all the published examples. To 
execute the FHIR validator, follow the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="downloads.html">Download</a> the FHIR Validator</li>
 <li><a href="downloads.html">Download</a> One of the FHIR definitions (with or without text)</li>
 <li>Execute the validator, providing the path to the definitions, and a reference to the resource to validate</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example windows batch file that demonstrates the process (using the common utilities <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm">wget</a> and <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7z</a>:
</p>
<pre>
 @ECHO OFF

 ECHO get the validator and unzip it 
 wget.exe http://hl7.org/fhir/validator.zip
 7z.exe x validator.zip

 ECHO Get the validation source file (dictionary)
 wget.exe http://hl7.org/fhir/validation-min.xml.zip

 ECHO get an example to validate
 wget.exe http://hl7.org/fhir/patient-example.html -O test-obs.xml

 ECHO validate it. The DAF profile will be loaded out of the definitions in validation-min.zip
 java -jar org.hl7.fhir.validator.jar test-obs.xml -defn validation-min.xml.zip -profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/daf-patient

 pause
</pre>
<p>
Note that it is not necessary to download the resource first; the http address can be supplied directly:
</p>
<pre>
 java -jar org.hl7.fhir.validator.jar http://hl7.org/fhir/patient-example.html -defn validation-min.xml.zip -profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/daf-patient
</pre>
<p>
The validator requires an underlying terminology server.
TODO: document this part. for now, hard coded to http://fhir-dev.healthintersections.com.au.
</p>

<a name="op"> </a>
<h3>Asking a FHIR Server</h3>

<p>
The <a href="operations.html">operation</a> <a href="resource-operations.html#validate">validate</a> can 
be used to check whether a resource conforms to a profile. The simplest way to execute this operation is
to post the resource to a server:
</p>
<pre>
 POST [base]/Patient/$validate?profile=http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/daf-patient
 [other HTTP headers]
 
 &lt;Patient&gt;.. resource to check as the body
</pre>
<p>
The server will return an <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> resource listing issues found in the resource.
</p>
<p>
There are several things to consider when using this operation:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Not all servers support the $validate operation, though some of the public test servers do</li>
 <li>Servers support the $validate operation generally will only validate against profiles already registered with the server</li>
 <li>Servers may choose to support either XML, JSON, or both</li>
</ul>

<a name="web"> </a>
<h3>Via a web interface</h3>

<p>
Some servers expose the $validate functionality 
though a web page. for known public implementations,
see the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Public_FHIR_Validation_Services">FHIR wiki</a>
