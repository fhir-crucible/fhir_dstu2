<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The PaymentReconciliation resource provides the bulk payment details 
associated with a payment by the payor for goods and services rendered by a provider to patients 
covered by insurance plans offered by that payor. These are the payment reconciliation details which 
align to the individual payment amounts indicated on discrete ClaimResponses.
</p>
<p>
Bulk payments need to provide a means to associate the amounts paid again specific Claims, 
and other financial exchanges and adjustments, to the bulk payment itself in order to reconcile
 provider accounts receivable.
