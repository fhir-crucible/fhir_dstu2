<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The EpisodeOfCare Resource contains information about an association of a Patient with a Healthcare Provider for a period
of time under which related healthcare activities may occur.
</p>
<p>
In many cases, this represents a period of time where the Healthcare Provider has some level of responsibility for the care
of the patient regarding a specific condition or problem, even if not currently participating in an encounter.
</p>
<p>
  These resources are typically known in existing systems as:
</p>
  <ul>
<li>EpisodeOfCare: Case, Program, Problem</li>
<li>Encounter: Visit, Contact</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
  The primary difference between the EpisodeOfCare and the Encounter is that the Encounter records the details of an
  activity directly relating to the patient, while the EpisodeOfCare is the container that can link a series of Enounters
  together for a specific problem/issue.<br/>
  The Example scenarios below give some good examples as to when you might want to be using an EpisodeOfCare.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
  Systems collect a coherent group of activities (such as encounters) related to a patient's health condition or problem often referred to as a Care Episode.

  Information about an episode is often shared across systems, and in some cases organizational and disciplinary boundaries.

  An Episode Of Care contains details about the purpose of the care and can exist without any activities.

  The minimal information that would be required in an episode of care would be a patient, healthcare provider and a reason for the ongoing association.

  Other reasons for creating an EpisodeOfCare could be for tracking the details required for government reporting or billing.
