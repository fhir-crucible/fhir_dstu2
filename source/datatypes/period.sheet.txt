=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = Period
  English = If present, start SHALL have a lower value than end
  XPath = not(exists(f:start)) or not(exists(f:end)) or (f:start/@value <= f:end/@value)

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Period
  Type = Type
  Short Label = Time range defined by start and end date/time
  Definition = A time period defined by a start and end date and optionally time.
  Comments = This is not a duration - that\'s a measure of time (a separate type), but a duration that occurs at a fixed value of time. A Period specifies a range of time; the context of use will specify whether the entire range applies (e.g. \"the patient was an inpatient of the hospital for this time range\") or one value from the range applies (e.g. \"give to the patient between these two times\"). If a duration might be required, specify the type as Interval|Duration
  v2 Mapping = DR
  RIM Mapping = IVL<TS>[lowClosed=\"true\" and highClosed=\"true\"] or URG<TS>[lowClosed=\"true\" and highClosed=\"true\"]

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Period.start
  Card. = 0..1
  Inv. = 1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Label = Starting time with inclusive boundary
  Definition = The start of the period. The boundary is inclusive.
  Comments = If the low element is missing, the meaning is that the low boundary is not known.
  v2 Mapping = DR.1
  RIM Mapping = ./low

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Period.end
  Card. = 0..1
  Inv. = 1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Label = End time with inclusive boundary, if not ongoing
  Definition = The end of the period. If the end of the period is missing, it means that the period is ongoing. The start mey be in the past, and the end date in the future, which means that period is expected/planned to end at that time
  Comments = The high value includes any matching date/time. i.e. 2012-02-03T10:00:00 is in a period that has a end value of 2012-02-03
  v2 Mapping = DR.2
  RIM Mapping = ./high
  Missing Meaning = If the end of the period is missing, it means that the period is ongoing
