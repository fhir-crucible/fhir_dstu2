<h2>Outstanding Issues</h2>

<p>
This specification is currently in it's second round of trial use. Much work remains to be done. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, there are still many outstanding questions about the Request/Fulfillment cycle (<a href="order.html">Order</a>/
<a href="orderresponse.html">OrderResponse</a> and how various statuses and workflows associated with requests, as well as how proposals
cascade to plans to orders to downstream/encoded orders, etc. This is a matter of ongoing investigation.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the following general areas of functionality have been deferred to a future version:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Adverse Event Reporting</li>
 <li>An alarm resource to represent current issues with the patient (e.g. device created)</li>
 <li>Concern Tracking</li>
 <li>Clinical Studies and Protocols</li>
 <li>Aggregated Data Reporting including Public Health Reporting</li>
 <li>Payment related resources, and specifically, an Account resource for payment tracking</li>
 <li>One or more resources for Advance Care Directive / Power of Attorney</li>
 <li>Use of RDF</li>
 <li>A full server side query framework</li>
</ul>
<p>
For some of these, some draft content is included in the specification as draft for implementer
consideration.
</p>

<p>
In addition, there is a number of specific notes through the specification requesting feedback 
from implementers:
