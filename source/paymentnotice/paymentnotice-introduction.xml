<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The PaymentNotice resource indicates the resource for which the payment has been indicated and 
reports the current status information of that payment. The payment notice may be used by Payor 
to advise the Provider or Regulatory bodies of the state of a payment (cheque in the mail/EFT sent, 
payment cashed, payment cancelled), Employers or Exchanges may use this to advise Payors of 
premium payment.
</p>
<p>
Payors have the need to advise Providers and/or regulators, in jurisdictions where these 
are supported, of the status of Claim settlement and payment completion. This same resource may 
be used by employers and insurance exchanges to advise Payors that premium payments have been 
issued and settled.
