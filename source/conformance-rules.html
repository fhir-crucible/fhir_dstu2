<p>
The FHIR specification describes a set of <a href="resource.html">resources</a>,
and several different frameworks for exchanging resources between different systems. 
Because of its general nature and wide applicability, the rules made in this 
specification are generally fairly loose. As a consequence, this specification 
allows that different applications may not be able to be interoperate because of 
how they use optional features. As a consequence, applications claiming 
conformance to this specification make the claim in respect of a specific 
exchange framework, and in regard to a specific details about their usage of 
those frameworks and resource contents. 
</p>
<p>
Application claim conformance to one (or more) of the following exchange
framworks:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>"RESTful FHIR": the <a href="http.html">RESTful api</a></li>
 <li>"FHIR messaging": <a href="messaging.html">message based exchange</a></li>
 <li>"FHIR documents": <a href="documents.html">document based exchange</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
To provide details about specific usage of the frameworks and resource 
contents, FHIR provides a <a href="profiling.html">conformance layer</a> that implementers and
national/regional programs can use to provide a computable statement about 
how the resources and their exchange paradigms are used to solve particular use cases. 
The conformance layer itself is implemented using the following key resources:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr> <td><a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a></td> <td>Defines a set of coded values (see "<a href="terminologies.html">Using Codes</a>" for more details)</td>  </tr>
 <tr> <td><a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a></td> <td>Makes rules about how a resource (or type) and its data elements are used in a particular context. A structure definition references value sets for the coded elements in a resource</td>  </tr>
 <tr> <td><a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a></td> <td>A statement of the kinds of resources and operations provided and/or consumed by an application. The conformance resource references profiles to describe specific use of resources by the application</td>  </tr>
 <tr> <td><a href="implementationguide.html">Implementation Guide</a></td> <td>A single coherent collection of conformance statements, profiles, value set, and documentation describing a set of interoperable applications</td>  </tr>
</table>
<p>
The specification also <a href="validation.html">provides a number of tools that can assist with enforcing technical conformance</a> 
to this base specification and profiles on it.
</p>
<p>
Conformance with this specification does not provide any guarantee of patient or data safety.
However, choosing to not conform to this specification carries additional risk in 
two ways:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>FHIR has been subject to a level of review and vetting unlikely to be received by any non-conformant variation; variations may result in introduction of undetected risks</li>
 <li>FHIR-like solutions (based on FHIR, but not conformant) may set expectations by trading partners which are not met due to the non-conformance of the system and these un-met expectations may also result in risk</li>
</ul>

<a name="cardinality"> </a>
<h3>Base Conformance Rules</h3>
<p>
The contents of a resource and the formats used to represent resources SHALL
conform to the rules described in this specification, as defined in the 
narrative of the specification, and as controlled by the conformance 
properties defined below.
</p>
<p>
Note: This specification uses the conformance verbs SHALL, SHOULD, and MAY as defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.
Unlike RFC 2119, however, this specification allows that different applications may not be able to be interoperate because of how they use optional features.
</p>
<p>
Data elements defined in resources and data types have 3 properties that are 
directly related to conformance: Cardinality, Is-Modifier, and Must-Support.
These interact to place conformance requirements on implementations. 
</p>

<a name="cardinality"> </a>
<h3>Cardinality</h3>
<p>
All attributes defined in FHIR have cardinality as part of their definition - a minimum number 
of required appearances and a maximum number. These numbers specify the number of times
the attribute may appear in any instance of the resource type. This specification
only defines the following cardinalities: 0..1, 0..*, 1..1, and 1..*. Profiles 
that describe specific use cases may use other values for cardinality within the limits 
of the cardinality defined by the base resource. 
</p>
<p>
Note that when present, elements cannot be empty - they SHALL have a value attribute, 
child elements, or extensions. This means that setting an element to a minimum cardinality
of 1 does not ensure that valid data will be present; specific XPath constraints are required
to ensure that the required data will be present.
</p>
<p>
In this specification, very few elements have a minimum cardinality of 1. 
Resources are used in many contexts, often quite removed from their primary
use case, and sometimes even basic information is quite incomplete. For this reason,
the only elements that have a minimum cardinality of 1 are those where they
are necessary to any understanding of the resource or element that contains them. 
The minimum cardinalities should not be taken as a guide to what elements
are expected to be present in any particular use of the resource, including their normal/primary usage purpose.
In some cases, this specification publishes additional profiles that define which elements are required in 
particular situations. Similar profiles are published by jurisdictions, vendors, or projects.
</p>
<p>
For elements that have cardinality &gt; 1, the order in which they appear may have meaning.
Unless the element definition (either in this specification or the extension) defines a meaning 
to the order explicitly, the meaning of the order is not defined, and implementations are allowed 
to reorder the elements. Note that it is not possible to define a meaning for the order of the elements in 
a <a href="profiling.html">profile</a> using a <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a>. 
When there is no definition of the meaning of the order, implementations that need to choose a 
single element from a list of elements for some use SHALL do so based on the semantics 
of the content of the elements that repeats. Profiles and Implementation guides may often make 
rules about this selection process.
</p>


<a name="mustUnderstand"> </a>
<a name="ismodifier"> </a>
<a name="isModifier"> </a>
<h3>Is-modifier</h3>
<p>
Is-Modifier is a boolean property that is assigned when an element is defined, either as part of 
the base resource contents in this specification, or when <a href="structuredefinition.html">extensions are defined</a>. 
An element is labeled "Is-Modifier = true" if the value it contains may change the 
interpretation of the element that contains it (including if the element is the resource as a whole). Typical examples of 
elements that are labeled "Is-Modifier" are elements such as "status", "active", "refuted", or "certainty". 
Whether an element is a modifier cannot be changed when element usage is described in a 
profile (i.e. a constraining <a href="structuredefinition.html">Structure Definition</a>).
When an element is labeled as Is-Modifier, the documentation must be clear about why 
it is a modifier.
</p>
<p>
A typical example of a modifier element is one that negates the element that contains it. For 
instance, in the following fragment of a resource definition:

</tbody></table>

<p>
The element "didNotOccurFlag" affects the entire meaning of the resource - if it is set to true, the 
whole resource must be understood differently, and so it is not safe for implementations to ignore it. 
As a consequence, it is labelled as 'is modifier = true'. In this tabular representation of the resource,
this shows as the flag '?!'. The <a href="json.html">JSON</a> and <a href="xml.html">XML</a> representations 
of a resource definition have their own representation of 'is modifier = true' status, and 
it is defined directly in a <a href="elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.isModifier">ElementDefinition</a>.
</p>
<p>
Is-Modifier elements SHALL be represented in the narrative summary of the resource.
</p>
<p>
If the value of a modifier element is not explicit in the instance, or known by the context, 
the resource may not be able to be safely understood. Wherever possible, elements labeled 
"Is-Modifier = true" also have a minimum cardinality of 1, or a default value, in order to 
introduce certainty in their handling. However sometimes this is not possible - much legacy 
data is not well described. Iimplementations producing resources SHOULD ensure that 
appropriate values for isModifier elements are provided at all times.
</p>
<p>
Implementations processing the data in resources SHALL understand the impact of the element when using the data. 
Implementations are not required to "support" the element in any meaningful way - they 
may achieve this understanding by rejecting instances that contain values outside those they support (for instance,
an application may refuse to accept observations with a reliability other than "ok"). Alternatively,
implementations may be able to be sure that, due to their implementation environment, such values 
will never occur. However applications SHOULD always check the value irrespective of this.
</p>
<p>
Note that processing the data of a resource typically means
copying or filtering data out of a resource for use in another 
context (display to a human, decision support, exchange in another 
format where not all information is included, or storing it for this kind of use).
Servers and background processes that simply move whole resources around unchanged 
are not "processing the data of the resource", and therefore these applications 
are not required to check Is-Modifier elements. 
</p>
<p>
Every element in the base resource has a value of "true" or "false" for the Is-Modifier flag. 
The value of the flag cannot be changed by profiles on the resource, in either direction. 
When a profile defines an extension, it labels the extension with the Is-Modifier flag,
and this cannot be changed in other profiles. Note that extensions that have is-Modifier = true
are represented differently in resource instances ("modifierExtension" instead of "extension"), 
and there are <a href="extensibility.html#modifierExtension">additional rules about how they are handled</a>.
</p>

<a name="mustSupport"> </a>
<h3>Must-Support</h3>
<p>
Labeling an element Must-Support means that implementations that produce or consume resources SHALL 
provide "support" for the element in some meaningful way. Exactly what this means is impossible
to describe or clarify as part of the FHIR specification.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, the specification itself never labels any elements as must-support. 
This is done in <a href="profiling.html#mustsupport">Resource Profiles</a>, where the profile 
labels an element as mustSupport=true. When a profile does this, it SHALL also make clear
exactly what kind of "support" is required, as this can mean many things.
</p>

<p>
Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a "key" element (e.g. one of 
the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both 
of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.
</p>

<a name="constraints"> </a>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
All elements may have constraints attached to them (also known as 'invariants'). 
Constraints defined on an element have the following properties:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td><b>Key</b></td><td>Identifies the constraint uniquely amongst all the constraints in the context - typically, this is used to refer to the constraint in an error message</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Requirements</b></td><td>An explanation of why the constraint has been applied - what harmful conditions are being avoided</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Severity</b></td><td>Whether the constraint is an error, or a warning. The exact difference in meaning of these depends on context, but an error is associated with "SHALL" and systems rejecting content, where as a warning might not be</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Human Description</b></td><td>A human description of the rule intended to be show as the explanation for a message when the constraint is not met</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>XPath Expression</b></td><td>An XPath expression taht must evaluate to true when run on the element in the XML representation. To use the constraint in JSON, the resource must be converted to XML</td></tr>
</table>
<blockquote class="dstu-note">
<a name="dstu"> </a>
<p>
<b>DSTU Note:</b>  Alternatives to XPath are being sought. Not only are XPath expressions XML specific, 
but the expressions defined in the specification require XSLT2, which is not well supported. 
The ideal solution will apply to either XML or JSON, and be widely supported in off the shelf tools. 
</p>
<p>
Feedback is welcome <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Specification_Feedback_(DSTU_2)">here</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Many constraints are defined in the base specification. In addition, additional 
constraints may be defined in <a href="profiling.html">profiles</a> that apply 
to resources. Systems are not required to evaluate the constraints, just as they 
are not required to check for conformance, or schema validatity. However, systems 
SHOULD alway ensure that all resources are valid against all applicable constraints.
</p>
<p>
Elements can also be explicitly associated with constraints defined elsewhere. This is 
a notification to implementers that the element is affected by the constraint. It has no meaning when the constraints are evaluated.
</p>
<p>
<a href="profiling.html">Profiles</a> may define additional constraints that 
apply to an element, but they cannot alter or remove constraints that are already
applied.
</p>


<a name="summary"> </a>
<a name="default"> </a>
<a name="meaning-when-missing"> </a>
<h3>Other Metadata</h3>
<p>
In addition to the conformance, metadata, each element has other metadata properties:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>isSummary</b> - How the element behaves in <a href="search.html#summary">Summary Searches</a></li>
 <li><b>defaultValue / meaningWhenMissing</b> - What it <a href="elementdefinition.html#missing">means when an element is missing</a></li>
 <li><b>maxLength</b> - How long the representation of the primitive value is allowed to be (not including XML or JSON escaping)</li>
</ul>


<a name="examples"> </a>
<h3>Examples and Reference Implementations</h3>
<p>
This specification includes many examples. While every effort has been made to ensure that the examples
are fully conformant to the specification, if the examples disagree with the specification, the specification 
is considered correct and normative, not the examples. This same rule applies to the reference implementations.
</p>
<p>
The examples reflected in this specification do *not* represent actual people.  Any resemblance to real people - alive 
or dead - is entirely coincidental.  In some cases, examples may be drawn from real clinical data.  
However, if this has occurred, the content has been scrubbed to remove any identifying information.
