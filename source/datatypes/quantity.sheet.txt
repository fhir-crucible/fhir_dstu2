
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = QuantityComparator
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #quantity-comparator
  Definition = How the Quantity should be understood and represented

=== Sheet quantity-comparator =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = <
  Display = Less than
  Definition = The actual value is less than the given value

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = <=
  Display = Less or Equal to
  Definition = The actual value is less than or equal to the given value

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = >=
  Display = Greater or Equal to
  Definition = The actual value is greater than or equal to the given value

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = >
  Display = Greater than
  Definition = The actual value is greater than the given value

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Context = Quantity
  English = If a code for the units is present, the system SHALL also be present
  XPath = not(exists(f:code)) or exists(f:system)

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Quantity
  Type = Type
  Short Label = A measured or measurable amount
  Definition = A measured amount (or an amount that can potentially be measured). Note that measured amounts include amounts that are not precisely quantified, including amounts involving arbitrary units and floating currencies
  Requirements = Need to able to capture all sorts of measured values, even if the measured value are not precisely quantified. Values include exact measures such as 3.51g, customary units such as 3 tablets, and currencies such as $100.32USD
  Comments = The context of use may frequently define what kind of quantity this is and therefore what kind of units can be used. The context of use may also restrict the values for the comparator
  v2 Mapping = SN (see also Range) or CQ
  RIM Mapping = PQ, IVL<PQ>, MO, CO, depending on the values

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Quantity.value
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = decimal
  Short Label = Numerical value (with implicit precision)
  Definition = The value of the measured amount. The value includes an implicit precision in the presentation of the value
  Requirements = Precision is handled implicitly in almost all cases of measurement
  Comments = The implicit precision in the value should always be honored. Monetary values have their own rules for handling precision (refer to standard accounting text books)
  v2 Mapping = SN.2  / CQ - N/A
  RIM Mapping = PQ.value, CO.value, MO.value, IVL.high or IVL.low depending on the value

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Quantity.comparator
  Card. = 0..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Type = code
  Binding = QuantityComparator
  Short Label = < | <= | >= | > - how to understand the value
  Definition = How the value should be understood and represented - whether the actual value is greater or less than the stated value due to measurement issues. E.g. if the comparator is \"<\" , then the real value is < stated value
  Requirements = Need a framework for handling measures where the value is <5ug/L or >400mg/L due to the limitations of measuring methodology.
  Comments = This is labeled as \"Is Modifier\" because the comparator modifies the interpretation of the value significantly. If there is no comparator, then there is no modification of the value
  v2 Mapping = SN.1  / CQ.1
  RIM Mapping = IVL properties
  Missing Meaning = If there is no comparator, then there is no modification of the value

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Quantity.unit
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Unit representation
  Definition = A human-readable form of the units
  Requirements = There are many representations for units and in many contexts, particular representations are fixed and required. I.e. mcg for micrograms
  v2 Mapping = (see OBX.6 etc) / CQ.2
  RIM Mapping = PQ.unit

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = Quantity.system
  Card. = 0..1
  Inv. = 3
  Type = uri
  Short Label = System that defines coded unit form
  Definition = The identification of the system that provides the coded form of the unit
  Requirements = Need to know the system that defines the coded form of the unit
  v2 Mapping = (see OBX.6 etc) / CQ.2
  RIM Mapping = CO.codeSystem, PQ.translation.codeSystem

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Quantity.code
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = code
  Short Label = Coded form of the unit
  Definition = A computer processable form of the units in some unit representation system
  Requirements = Need a computable form of the units that is fixed across all forms. UCUM provides this for quantities, but SNOMED CT provides many units of interest
  Comments = The preferred system is UCUM, but SNOMED CT can also be used (for customary units) or ISO 4217 for currency.  The context of use may additionally require a code from a particular system
  v2 Mapping = (see OBX.6 etc) / CQ.2
  RIM Mapping = PQ.code, MO.currency, PQ.translation.code
