A logical model is a expression of a set of content in a FHIR ready style that helps implementers understand the content is a single package.
Because of the way FHIR works, a single logical model may be actually represented during exchange by a set of resources, 
including a series of observations and questionnaires. 
Typically, profiles that define how the resources are used are derived from the logical model.
