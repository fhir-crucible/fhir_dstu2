<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->
This resource summarizes a set of images or other instances gathered for some specified purpose, and provides references 
to where the images are available using WADO-RS. This resource is used to make available information concerning images etc. 
that are intended to be exchanged into other clinical contexts such as diagnostic reports, Care Plans, etc.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
In distinction to ImagingStudy, this resource is a set of specifically selected objects, potentially from multiple studies on the same patient.  ImagingStudy is intended as the resource that identifies a single complete study in itself.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
This resource corresponds to the DICOM Key Object Selection (KOS) SOP Class, and may represent a FHIR access mechanism to the content of KOS SOP Instances. The content is closely based on the definitions of the equivalent DICOM constructs, and informed by usage patterns already established through DICOM implementation practices, including IHE KIN, TCE, and XDS-I profiles. However, it is not necessary to use DICOM infrastructure in order to use this resource.
