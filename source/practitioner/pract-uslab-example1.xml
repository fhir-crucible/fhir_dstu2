  Narrative: A male child of age 3 is taken by his aunt, who is his legal guardian, to be seen by a physician. The child has his blood tested for blood lead. A blood sample is taken from his left finger, using a capillary collection method on a filter paper card. The specimen collection date is 6/15/2012; date of result is 6/17/2012. Both his medical record ID and SSN are included in the patient information along with name, DOB, race/ethnicity, current and home address, and his aunt's business, home and mobile phone number and email address. The lab result is a blood lead level by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) of 9.2 ug/dL and the jurisdiction threshold is 5.0 (reference range of 0.0-5.0). This results in an abnormal flag of “High”. University Hospital has an on-site lab and results blood level tests under the performing lab name of “University Hospital Chem Lab”. These results are sent to the local public health agency.
