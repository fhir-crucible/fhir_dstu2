<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DAFVitalSigns profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for vital signs of a particular patient</li>
	<li>Query for all patients whose vital signs are out of the reference range</li>
	<li>Query for patients with a particular type of vital sign measurement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Implementation Guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	<p><b>Specifying Patients as part of the Vital Signs Queries:</b> DAFVitalSigns profile supports the querying the vital signs for a particular patient. In order to achieve this in implementation, it is recommended to use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the observations relevant to the patient. While other parameters such as  Patient.name, Patient.given could be used this could lead to incorrect Patient matching and/or inefficient queries when systems are not tuned. </p>
	
	<p><b>Patient Matching:</b> Patient Matching rules and criteria have to be evaluated by the implementing organization and have to comply with local policies and regulations. Query Requestors will have to deal with result sets that can return zero,one or more Observation Resources in response to a query.</p>
</ul>
