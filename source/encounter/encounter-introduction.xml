<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p> 
A patient encounter is further characterized by the setting in which it takes place. Amongst them are ambulatory,
 emergency, home health, inpatient and virtual encounters. An Encounter encompasses the lifecycle from pre-admission, 
 the actual encounter (for ambulatory encounters), and admission, stay and discharge (for inpatient encounters). 
During the encounter the patient may move from practitioner to practitioner and location to location.
</p>
<p>
Because of the broad scope of Encounter, not all elements will be relevant in all settings. For this reason, 
admission/discharge related information is kept in a separate Hospitalization component within Encounter. 
The <i>class</i> element is used to distinguish between these settings, which will guide further validation and
application of business rules.
</p>
<p>
There is also substantial variance from organization to organization (and between jurisdictions and countries) 
on which business events translate to the start of a new Encounter, or what level of aggregation is used for Encounter. For example, each
single visit of a practitioner during a hospitalization may lead to a new instance of Encounter, but depending on
local practice and the systems involved, it may well be that this is aggregated to a single instance for a whole hospitalization.
Even more aggregation may occur where jurisdictions introduce groups of Encounters for financial or other reasons.
Encounters can be aggregated or grouped under other Encounters using the <i>partOf</i> element. 
See <a href="#examples">below</a> for examples.
</p>

<p>
Encounter instances may exist before the actual encounter takes place to convey pre-admission information, including
using Encounters elements to reflect the planned start date or planned encounter locations. In 
this case the <i>status</i> element is set to 'planned'.
</p>

<p>
The Hospitalization component is intended to store the extended information relating to a hospitalization event.
This is always expected to be the same period as the encounter itself, where this is different then another
encounter is entered which captures this information which is a partOf this encounter instance.
</p>

<h3>Status Management</h3>
<p>
During the life-cycle of an encounter it will pass through many statuses. Typically these are in order or the
organizations workflow: planned, in-progress, finished/cancelled.<br/>
This status information is often used for other things, and often an analysis of the status history is required.
This could be done my scanning throuh all the versions of the encounter and then checking the period of each,
and doing some form of post processing. To ease the burden of this (or where a system doesn't support resource
histories) a status history component is included.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p> 
The Encounter resource is not to be used to store appointment information, the Appointment resource is intended to be used for that.
Note that in many systems outpatient encounters (which are in scope for Encounter) and Appointment are used 
concurrently. In FHIR, Appointment is used for establishing a date for the encounter, while Encounter is 
applicable to information about the actual Encounter, i.e. the patient showing up.<br/>
As such an encounter in the "planned" status is not identical to the appointment that scheduled it,
but it is the encounter prior to its actual occurrence, with the expectation that encounter will be
updated as it progresses to completion. Patient arrival at a location does not necessarily mean the
start of the encounter (e.g., a patient arrives an hour earlier than he is actually seen by a practitioner).
</p>
<p>
An appointment is normally used for the planning stage of an appointment, searching, locating an available time, then
making the appointment. Once this process is completed and the appointment is about to start, then the appointment
will be marked as fulfilled, and linked to the newly created encounter.<br/>
This new encounter may start in an "arrived" status when they are admitted with a location of the facility, and then will
move to the ward where another part-of encounter may begin.
</p>
<p>
Standard Extension: <b>Associated Encounter</b><br/>
This extension should be used to reference an encounter where there is no property that already defines this association on the resource.
