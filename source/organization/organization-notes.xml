			There are two places for contact information: one on Organization itself and zero or more using the ContactEntity construct.
			The first one is to be used for the generic, public organization point of contact. The ContactEntity is to be used for
			reaching a person or party that has been designated by the organization to be contacted for a specific purpose or goal.
