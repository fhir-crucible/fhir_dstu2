This patient information is not intended to be updated once the Document is registered (just as the Document content and metadata itself will not be updated without replacing the previous document). As sourcePatientInfo may have been updated by the source actor, it may no longer be in use within the Document Source (EHR-CR).

 -- Row 27 -----------------------------------
  Element = DocumentReference.content.format
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = Coding
  Short Label = XDSDocumentEntry.formatCode
  Definition = Code globally uniquely specifying the format of the document. Along with the typeCode, it should provide sufficient information to allow any potential XDS Document Consumer to know if it will be able to process the document. The formatCode shall be sufficiently specific to ensure processing/display by identifying a document encoding, structure and template (e.g., for a CDA Document, the fact that it complies with a CDA schema, possibly a template and the choice of a content-specific style sheet).

  Comments = An event can further specialize the act inherent in the typeCode, such as where it is simply \"Procedure Report\" and the procedure was a \"colonoscopy\". If one or more eventCodes are included, they shall not conflict with the values inherent in the classCode, practiceSettingCode or typeCode, as such a conflict would create an ambiguous situation. This short list of codes is provided to be used as ???key words??? for certain types of queries

The value shall not conflict with the value inherent in the typeCode, as such a conflict would create an ambiguous situation
