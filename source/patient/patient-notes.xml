<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>multipleBirth can be either expressed as a boolean (just indicating whether the patient is part of a multiple birth) or as an integer, indicating the actual birth order.</li>
<li>Patient records may only be in one of two statuses: in use (active=true) and not in use (active=false). 
A normal record is active, i.e. it is in use. Active is set to 'false' when a record is created as a duplicate or in error. 
A record does not need to be linked to be inactivated.
</li>
<li>The <i>link</i> element is used to assert that two or more Patient resources are both about the same actual patient. 
See below for further discussion</li>
<li>There should be only one preferred language (Language.preference = true) per mode of expression.</li>
<li>The Contact for a Patient has an element <i>organization</i>, this is for use with guardians or business related contacts where just the organization is relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Patient id's and Patient resource id's</h2>
<p>A Patient record's Resource Id can never change. For this reason the identifiers with 
which humans are concerned (often called MRN - Medical Record Number, or UR - Unit Record) should not 
be used for the resource's id, since MRN's may change, i.e. as a result of having duplicate records of
the same patient. Instead they should be represented in the <i>Patient.identifier</i> 
list where they can be managed. This is also useful for the case of institutions that have acquired 
multiple numbers because of mergers of patient record systems over time.

<h2>Linking Patients</h2>
<p>The <i>link</i> element is used to assert that patient resources refer to the same patient. This element is used
to support the following scenarios where multiple patient records exist:</p>

<h3>Duplicate Patient records</h3>
<p>Managing Patient registration is a well known difficult problem. Around 2% of registrations are in error, 
mostly duplicate records. Sometimes the duplicate record is caught fairly quickly and retired before much 
data is accumulated. In other cases, substantial amounts of data may accumulate. By using a link of type 'replace',
the record containing such a link is marked as a duplicate and the link points forward to a record that should
be used instead. Note that the record pointed to may in its turn have been identified as created in error and forward
to yet another Patient resource. Records that replace another record, do not point back to the replaced record.
</p>

<h3>Patient record in a Patient index</h3>
<p>A Patient record may be present in a system that acts as a Patient Index: it maintains a (summary of) patient data and
a list of one or more servers that it are known to hold a more comprehensive and/or authorative record of the same patient.
The link type 'refer' is used denote such a link. Note that linked records may contain contradictory information. The
record referred to does not point back to the referring record.</p>

<h3>Distributed Patient record</h3>
<p>In a distributed architecture, multiple systems keep separate patient records concerning the same patient. These
records are not considered duplicates, but contain a distributed, potentially overlapping view of the patient's data.
Each such record may have its own focus or maintaining organization and there need not be a sense of one record
being more complete or more authorative than another. In such cases, links of type 'seealso' can be used to point to
other patient records. It is not a requirement that such links are bilateral. 
</p>

<h2>Patient vs Person vs Patient.Link</h2>
<p>
The Person resource on the surface appears to be very similar to the Patient resource, and the usage for it is very similar
to using the Patient.Link capability.<br/>
The intention of the Person resource is to be able to link instances of resources together that are believed to be the same
individual. This includes across resource types, such as RelatedPerson, Practitioner, Patient and even other Person resources.<br/>
The Patient Link however is only intended to be used for Patient resources.
</p>
<p>
The primary use case for the Person resource is to be able to support Person registries that do not necessarily have a
healthcare context, and are able to identify and quantify confidence levels that this is the same person.<br/>
This could include consumer portals where the actual maintainer of the Person information is the actual person themselves.<br/>
A system could use the Person entry to cross check changes to information applied to one part of a record to values in another
system. e.g. A Consumer updates his contact numbers and address when moving in his Person record, and then a Patient Administation
system is able to see that this data is changed, and prompt the organization to follow up with the patient that was linked to
the person record if they want their details updated, or if they no longer need services and they should be cancelled, 
as they've moved from the area.
</p>
  
<h2>Patient.Contact vs RelatedPerson</h2>
<p>
The contact component on the Patient Resource should be used for storing people to contact information.
Where a system has a separate record for other people for purposes other than just the contact details, The RelatedPerson
resource should be used.<br/>
This includes cases where these related people are actually contributing to the record, and need to be referenced individually 
(e.g. CarePlan.Participant, Encounter, DocumentReference, Appointment) where the Patient.Contact component cannot be used.
</p>
<p>It is not expected that these records will be used for primary care provider, this information should be stored in
the Patient.careProvider field.</p>

<h2>Merging records</h2>
<p>
This specification does not specify merge functionality: if multiple patient records are found to be 
duplicates, they can be linked together, as described above. These links merely express the relationship
between records, and in the case of a replacement link, indicate a "master" record.  This specification
does not mandate that FHIR servers migrate information between such records on finding such a link. Note:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Health information administrators may call the process "merging", but it is often implemented as "linking" at the record level</li>
 <li>Servers are allowed to implement merging/record migration even though it is not mandated. </li>
</ul>
