		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
			This is FHIR Profile is mapped from the Smoking Status CCDA Entry Template : <i>HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA R2: IHE Health 	Story Consolidation, DSTU R1.1</i>, Section 5.75  Smoking Status Observation [observation: templateId 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.78 (open)] 
		</p>
		<p>
		This clinical statement represents a patient's current smoking status. The 
		vocabulary selected for this clinical statement is the best approximation of the
		statuses in Meaningful Use (MU) Stage 1.
		</p>
		<p>
		If the patient is a smoker (77176002), the effectiveTime/low element must be 
		present. If the patient is an ex-smoker (8517006), both the effectiveTime/low 
		and effectiveTime/high element must be present.
		</p>
		<p>
		The smoking status value set includes a special code to communicate if the 
		smoking status is unknown which is different from how Consolidated CDA 
		generally communicates unknown information.</p>
