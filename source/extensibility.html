<h1>Extensibility</h1>
<p>
This exchange specification is based on generally agreed common
requirements across healthcare - covering many jurisdictions, domains, and
different functional approaches. It is common for
specific implementations to have valid requirements that are not
part of these agreed common requirements. Incorporating all of these requirements
would make this specification very cumbersome and difficult to
implement. Instead, this specification expects that these additional
distinct requirements will be implemented as extensions.
</p>
<p>
As such, extensibility is a fundamental part of the design of this
specification. Every element in a resource may have extension child elements 
to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition 
of the resource. Applications should not reject resources merely because
they contain extensions, though they may need to reject resources 
because of the specific contents of the extensions.
</p>
<p>
Note that, unlike in many other specifications, there can be no stigma
associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or
standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the
extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core
simplicity for everyone.
</p>
<p>
In order to make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a
strict governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though
any implementer is allowed to define and use extensions, there is a set of requirements
that must be met as part of their use and definition.

<h2>Extension Element</h2>
<p>
Every element in a resource or data type includes an optional "extension" child element that may 
be present any number of times. This is the content model of the extension as it appears in each resource:
</p>
<%dt Extension%>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <i>url</i> is a mandatory attribute / property and identifies a retrievable <a href="structuredefinition.html">extension definition</a> that defines the content and meaning of the extension.</li>
 <li>An extension SHALL have either a value (i.e. a value[x] element) or sub-extensions, but not both. If present, the value[x] element SHALL have content (value attribute or other elements)</li>
 <li>If it is not safe for an application processing the content of the resource to ignore the extension it must be represented diffferent (see <a href="#modifier">below</a>)</li>
 <li>The <i>value[x]</i> element has an actual name of "value" and then the TitleCased name of one of these defined types, and its contents are those as defined for that type:
  <ul class="dense">
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#integer">Integer</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#decimal">Decimal</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#dateTime">DateTime</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#date">Date</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#instant">Instant</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#string">String</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#uri">Uri</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#boolean">Boolean</a></li>
   <li><a href="datatypes.html#code">Code</a> (only if the extension definition provides a <a href="terminologies.html#code">fixed</a> binding to a suitable set of codes)</li>

   <li><a href="datatypes.html#Signature">Signature</a></li>
   <li><a href="references.html#Reference">Reference</a> - a reference to another resource</li>
  </ul>
 </li> 
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p>
Here is an example of an extension in XML:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="HumanName">
&lt;name&gt;
  &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso-21090-name-use&quot; &gt;
    &lt;valueCode value=&quot;I&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;text value=&quot;Chief Red Cloud&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In this example, the name with text = "Chief Red Cloud" is extended to have a 
name use code of "Indigenous" (defined in ISO 21090, but very rarely used in 
practice). 
</p>
<p>
In JSON, extensions are represented similarly:
</p>
<pre class="json" fragment="HumanName">
  "name" : {
    "extension" : [{
      "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso-21090-name-use",
      "valueCode" : "I"
    }],
   "text" : "Chief Red Cloud"
  }
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Making the types explicit in the representation means that all systems can read and write 
(and therefore store and/or exchange) extensions correctly without needing to access the
definition of the extension.
</p>
<p>
Extensions can also contain extensions, either because the extension 
definition itself defines complex content - that is, a nested tree of values 
in the extension, or because the extension is extended with an additional 
extension defined separately. 
</p>
<p>
In the first case, the identity of the parts of the extension are local/relative to the reference
to the extension definition.
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
As an example, consider extending a patient with an 
opt-in status for a clinical trial, with 3 fields: status, date of recording, and 
the person who enrolled them (see <a href="??">definition</a>). In XML:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Patient">
&lt;Patient&gt;
  &lt;extension url=&quot;http://acme.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/trial-status&quot; &gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;code&quot; &gt;
      &lt;valueCode value=&quot;unsure&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;date&quot; &gt;	  
      &lt;valueDate value=&quot;2009-03-14&quot; /&gt;	  
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;registrar&quot; &gt;	  
      &lt;valueReference&gt;	  
        &lt;reference value=&quot;Practitioner/example&quot; /&gt;	  	    
      &lt;/valueReference&gt;	  
    &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;!-- other data for patient --&gt;
&lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Or in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json" fragment="Patient">
{
  "resourceType" : "Patient",
  "extension" : [{
    "url" : "http://acme.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/trial-status",
    "extension" : [{
      "url" : "code",
      "valueCode" : "unsure"
    }, {
      "url" : "date", 
      "valueDate" : "2009-03-14" 
    },  {
      "url" : "registrar",
      "valueReference" : {
        "reference" : "Practitioner/example"
       }
    }]
  }]
  ... other data for patient ...
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the second case, the contained extension is defined separately.
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
In this case, the registrar is defined as a separate extension (e.g. to 
allow wider use), rather than part of the clinical-trial extension. 
The url of the extension is different:
</p>
<pre class="xml" fragment="Patient">
&lt;Patient&gt;
  &lt;extension url=&quot;http://acme.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/trial-status&quot; &gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;code&quot; &gt;
      &lt;valueCode value=&quot;unsure&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;date&quot; &gt;
      &lt;valueDate value=&quot;2009-03-14&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;http://acme.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/registrar&quot; &gt;
      &lt;valueReference array="true"&gt;
        &lt;reference value=&quot;Practitioner/example&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/valueReference&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
  &lt;!-- other data for patient --&gt;
&lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json" fragment="Patient">
{
  "resourceType" : "Patient",
  "extension" : [{
    "url" : "http://acme.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/trial-status",
    "extension" : [{
      "url" : "code",
      "valueCode" : "unsure"
    }, {
      "url" : "date",
      "valueDate" : "2009-03-14"
    }, {
      "url" : "http://acme.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/registrar",
      "valueReference" : {
        "reference" : "Practitioner/example"
      }
    }]
  }]
  ... other data for patient ...
}
</pre>
</div>

<a name="isModifier"> </a>
<a name="modifierExtension"> </a>
<h2>Modifier Extensions</h2>
<p>
There are some cases where the information provided in extensions modifies the meaning 
of the element that contains it. Typically, this means information that qualifies or 
negates the primary meaning of the element that contains it. Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>An anti-prescription: recording an instruction <b>not</b> to take a medication</li>
 <li>Using the <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource to record an assertion that a patient <b>doesn't</b> have a particular diagnosis (as opposed to refuted)</li>
 <li>Asserting that a performer was <b>not</b> actually involved in a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a></li>
 <li>Asserting an additional subsumption relationship on a concept in a <a href="valueset.html">value set</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Implementers should avoid the use of modifier extensions where possible.  Any use should be 
carefully considered against its possible downstream consequences. However, implementers
are often forced into these situations by the business arrangements around
the use of resources, so this specification creates a framework for handling these cases.
If modifier extensions are present, an application cannot safely process the resource unless it knows
what the extension means for its own use of the data.
</p>
<p>
This specification allows for such modifier elements to be included at the base of a resource or in any elements
that do not have a data type (e.g. the elements that correspond to classes in the resource UML
diagrams). Elements that are data types, or that are inside data types SHALL NOT have modifier extensions.
</p>
<p>
In XML, these modifier elements are represented using an element named "modifierExtension", which has same content as the 
<i>extension</i> element documented above: 
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
Example: There's no element on <a href="medicationprescription.html">MedicationPescription</a> 
to write an "anti-prescription" - an instruction not to take a medication for a particular time.
Classical clinical recording systems do not record this as a prescription - but one particular
system does, and these "anti-prescription" records need to be shared within the institution 
where this happens, as they are an important part of the workflow.  Hence, applications are allowed to extend a resource with data like this: 
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;MedicationPescription&gt;
  &lt;modifierExtension url=&quot;http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/anti-prescription&quot;&gt;
    &lt;valueBoolean value="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/modifierExtension&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... other content ... --&gt;
&lt;/Procedure&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Or in JSON:
</p>
<pre class="json">
{
  "resourceType" : "MedicationPescription",
  "modifierExtension" : [{
    "url" : "http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/anti-prescription",
    "valueBoolean" : "true"
  }],
  .. other content ...
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Implementations processing the data in resources SHALL 
check for modifiers anywhere they may appear, and if 
a modifier extension is present, SHALL do one of these
things:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>understand the impact of the extension when using the data</li>
 <li>refuse to process the data</li>
 <li>carry a warning concerning the data along with any action or output that results from processing the data to inform users that it has not fully understood the source information</li>
</ol>
<p>
Processing the data of a resource typically means
copying or filtering data out of a resource for use in another 
context (display to a human, decision support, exchange in another 
format where not all information is included, or storing it for this kind of use).
Servers and background processes that simply move whole resources around unchanged 
are not "processing the data of the resource", and therefore these applications 
are not required to check for unknown modifier extensions. 
</p>
<p>
<b>#1</b>: When an application understands this extension, it means that some developer
has provided appropriate instructions for what to do with the data contained 
in it because of the existence of the modifier extension. 
</p>
<p><b>#2</b>: 
This means that implementations are not inherently required to "support" 
a modifier extension in any meaningful way - they may achieve this 
understanding by rejecting instances that contain this extension.
Applications may also be able to ignore a modifier extension if that 
can know that this is safe to do in its own context, though this would not usually be the case.
</p>
<p> 
Note that implementations may be able to be sure, due to their 
implementation environment (e.g. specific trading partner agreement), 
that modifier extensions will never occur, and can therefore meet
the requirement to check for modifiers at the design stage. 
However, since integration and deployment options often change
subsequently, applications SHOULD always check for modifier extensions when 
processing resources anyway.
</p>

<p><b>#3</b>: 
One way to warn the user is to download the extension definition
from the given URL, and then use the defined display name to present
the extension to the user. An error message could look something like
this:
</p>
<img src="modifier-extension-warning.png"/>
<p>
Note that the narrative of the resource SHALL contain this qualifying 
information, so it is safe to show this to the user as an expression 
of the resource's content. A warning dialog box could be extended to
offer the user the choice to see the original narrative. 
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
Here is the prescription example from above with narrative:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;MedicationPescription xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;status value=&quot;generated&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: This prescription is an instruction NOT to take a medication&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;!-- snip actual narrative --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;!-- ...data... --&gt;
  &lt;modifierExtension url=&quot;http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/anti-prescription&quot;&gt;
    &lt;boolean value="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/modifierExtension&gt;
  &lt;!-- ...data... --&gt;
&lt;/MedicationPescription&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
An application only needs to concern itself with modifierExtensions on elements that
it processes. Take, for example, the case above where a procedure resource 
has a modifierExtension on one of the performer elements indicating that they did 
not participate in the procedure. In this case, if an application is not using the performer details at all,
the fact that one of the performers has a modifierExtension is irrelevant and the 
application is free to ignore it. If it does process the performers, and it sees the
modifier extension, it must act in one of the ways outlined above.
</p>

<h3>Summary: Conformance Rules for Modifier Extensions</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Modifier Extensions SHALL only modify the element which contains it and/or that element's children</li>
 <li>It SHALL always be safe to show the narrative to humans; any modifier extension SHALL be represented in the narrative</li>
 <li>Applications SHALL always check for modifier extensions when processing the data from any element that may carry one</li>
 <li>If a modifier Extension they do not understand is present, the application SHALL either refuse to process the resource or affected element, or provide an appropriate warning to its users</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Case: Missing data</h3>
<p>
In some cases, implementers may find that they do not have appropriate data for an
element with minimum cardinality = 1. In this case, the element must be present, but 
unless the resource or a profile on it has made the actual value of the primitive 
data type mandatory, it is possible to provide an extension that explains why the 
primitive value is not present:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
&lt;uri&gt;
  &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason&quot;&gt;
    &lt;code=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/uri&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In this example, instead of a value, a <a href="general-extensions.html">data missing code</a> is provided. Note that 
it is not required that this particular extension be used. This extension 
is <b>not</b> a modifier extension, because the primitive data type has no
value. 
</p>
<p>
It is not valid to create a fictional piece of data for the primitive value,
and then to add an extension indicating that the data has been constructed
to meet the data rules. This would be both a bad idea, and also a modifier
extension, which is not allowed on data types. 
</p>

<a name="exchange"> </a>
<h2>Exchanging Extensions</h2>

<p>
Extensions are a way of allowing local requirements to be reflected in a resource using
a common information based approach so that all systems can confidently process them 
using the same tools. However, when it comes to processing the information, applications
will be constrained in their ability to handle extensions by the degree to which they 
are informed about them. 
</p>
<p>
While the structured definition of an extension should always be available (see below for 
details), the mere availability of a definition does not automatically mean that applications
know how to handle them correctly - generally, human decisions are required to be made around
how the data in extensions contain should be handled, along with the implicit obligations 
that surround the information. 
</p>
<p>
For this reason, local requirements that manifest as extensions are an obstacle to 
integration. The more the requirements are shared (i.e. regional or national scale),
the less impact they will have. The consistent representation, definition and registration of 
extensions that this specification defines cannot resolve that problem - it only provides a framework 
within which such local variations can be handled more easily. 
</p>
<p>
When it comes to deploying applications that support local requirements, situations
will very likely arise where different applications
exchanging information with each other are supporting different sets of extensions.
This specification makes some basic rules that are intended to make management
of these situations easier, but they cannot resolve them.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When exchanging resources, systems SHOULD retain unknown extensions when they are capable of doing so (just as they SHOULD retain core elements when they are capable of doing so)</li>
 <li>If a system modifies a resource it SHOULD remove any extensions that it does not understand from the 
modified element and its descendants, because it cannot know whether the modifications it has made 
might invalidate the value of the unknown extension</li>
 <li>Systems that drop existing elements are considered to be "processing the resource"</li>
 <li>A system SHALL not modify a resource or element that contains "modifier" extensions it doesn't understand</li>
 <li>Applications SHOULD ignore extensions that they do not recognize if they are not "modifier" extensions</li>
 <li>Systems that do not accept unknown extensions SHALL declare so in their Conformance resource instances</li>
</ul>
<p>
The degree to which a system can retain unknown extensions is a function of the type of system
it is: a general purpose FHIR server, or a middleware engine would be expected to retain 
all extensions, while an application that manages patient registration through a user 
interface can only retain extensions to the degree that the information in them is part of the
set managed by the user. Other applications will fall somewhere between these two extremes.
</p>

<h3>Summary: Handling extensions</h3>
<p>
Use the following rules as a guideline for handling resources:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>When writing extensions, make sure they are defined and published</li>
 <li>When reading, navigating through or searching on elements that can have modifier extensions, check whether there are any</li>
 <li>When reading elements, read and process the extensions you know and use, and ignore other extensions</li>
 <li>Retain extensions whenever you can</li>
</ul>
