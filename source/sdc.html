<h2>Structured Data Capture (SDC) Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>
This implementation guide is intended to support clinical systems in the creation and population of forms with patient-specific data.  It defines a mechanism for
linking questions in forms to pre-defined data elements to enable systems to automatically populate portions of the form based on existing data, either locally or
by invoking an operation on a third-party system.
</p>
<p>
This implementation guide is prepared as a U.S. Realm Specification on behalf of the 
Structured Data Capture - an effort under the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/about-onc">U.S. Office of the National Coordinator (ONC)</a>'s Standards and Infrastructure (S &amp; I) Framework.
However, much of the content is likely to be useable in other jurisdictions.
</p>

<h3>Comment-only Ballot</h3>
<p>
This FHIR Implementation Guide is balloted as comment-only.  The focus of the ballot is limited in scope to the IG, the profiles, operations, value sets and conformance
statements it defines, though comments on the underlying resources will also be accepted.  This guide will be balloted together with the FHIR specification itself as part of the
second FHIR DSTU as part of the April-May ballot cycle.  This will provide an opportunity to provide feedback on all aspects of the FHIR specification.

<h3>Specification</h3>
<p>
The <i>SDC FHIR Implementation Guide</i> is based on the <a href="index.html">HL7 FHIR</a> standard.  It makes use of the following resources:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> is used to define data elements that can be referenced in questionnaires and can be used to auto-populate form data</li>
  <li><a href="questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> is used to define form definitions that may be downloaded for manual and/or automatic population</li>
  <li><a href="questionnaireanswers.html">QuestionnaireAnswers</a> is used to share instance data captured using questionnaire forms</li>
  <li><a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> is used to define allowed values for data elements and for questions in questionnaires</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional resources such as <a href="patient.html">Patient</a>, <a href="practitioner.html">Practitioner</a>, <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a>, 
<a href="securityevent.html">SecurityEvent</a> and others are likely to be used in SDC solutions, though
no SDC-specific profiles have been created for them.    Basic aspects of the FHIR protocol, including <a href="http.html">RESTful operations</a>, 
<a href="datatypes.html">data types</a>, <a href="search.html">search</a>, etc. also apply.
<!-- Todo: decide how explicit the list of relevant sections needs to be -->
</p>
<p>
The SDC specification consists of the following components:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>SDC profiles</b> - Profiles on the four FHIR resources used to support the IG requirements:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="dataelement-sdc.html">SDC Data Element (DE) Profile</a> - Constraints and extensions for capturing data elements</li>
      <li><a href="questionnaire-sdc.html">SDC Questionnaire Profile</a> - Constraints and extensions for capturing form designs</li>
      <li><a href="questionnaireanswers-sdc.html">SDC Questionnaire Answers Profile</a> - Constraints and extensions for capturing form data instances</li>
      <li><a href="valueset-sdc.html">SDC Value Set Profile</a> - Constraints and extensions for defining lists of allowed codes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#population">Pre-population Operation</a> - The definition of the custom service that allows pre-population of forms based on 
  CDA and other data sources</li>
  <li><b>Conformance statements</b> - Definitions for the expected capabilities of each of the actors involved in supporting SDC functionality:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="conformance-sdc-de-manager.html">SDC Data Element Manager</a> - Repository for data elements</li>
      <li><a href="conformance-sdc-form-designer.html">SDC Form Designer</a> - System responsible for creating and editing forms</li>
      <li><a href="conformance-sdc-form-filler.html">SDC Form Filler</a> - System responsible for capturing user form input</li>
      <li><a href="conformance-sdc-form-manager.html">SDC Form Manager</a> - Repository for form definitions.  May also perform pre-population</li>
      <li><a href="conformance-sdc-form-receiver.html">SDC Form Receiver</a> - Repository for completed forms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<a name="population"> </a>
<h3>Pre-population service</h3>
<p>
The <a href="questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> resource defines a custom operation called <a href="questionnaire-operations.html#populate">populate</a>.
This operation supports generating a "blank" <a href="questionnaireanswers.html">QuestionnaireAnswers</a> instance based on a specified
<a href="questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a>.  It also allows for the returned questionnaire to be partially or even fully completed based
on data passed in to the operation or data already available to the server on which the operation is invoked.
</p>
<p>
For SDC purposes, server systems claiming to support roles that require support for the <code>populate</code> operation 
(<a href="conformance-sdc-form-manager.html">SDC Form Manager</a>) SHALL, at minimum:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Handle the input parameters <code>identifier</code>, <code>questionnaire</code>, <code>subject</code> and <code>content</code></li>
  <li>Support <code>content</code> parameters consisting of a <a href="http.html#binary">Binary</a> resource containing a C-CDA document</li>
  <li>Populate the returned <a href="questionnaireanswers.html">QuestionnaireAnswers</a> instance for all questions referencing
  <a href="dataelement.html">DataElements</a> that are mapped to C-CDA content</li>
</ul>
<p>
Similarly, client systems claiming to support the <code>populate</code> operation (<a href="conformance-sdc-form-filler.html">SDC Form Filler</a>)
SHALL, at a minimum:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be capable of invoking the operation on a selected questionnaire both directly (<code>Questionnaire/[identifier]/$populate</code>)
as well as indirectly either by <code>identifier</code> or <code>questionnaire</code></li>
  <li>Support passing a single C-CDA document as a <a href="http.html#binary">Binary</a> resource using the <code>content</code> parameter</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
</p>
<p>
Not all <a href="dataelement.html">DataElements</a> will be appropriate or safe to reference in a Questionnaire.  It is important that the definition
associated with the data element fully reflects the context of the question in the questionnaire.  For example, "gender" would not be a safe data element
because it would not be clear whether the gender was that of the patient or a fetus of the patient.  It must be clear from the data element definition
exactly what piece of information should be extracted from a source system, CCDA document or other data source.</p>
<p>
Mapping to CCDA, where applicable, should be constrained and specific (e.g. for particular demographic sections) rather than making it open and generic.  These mappings should be per ONC's recommendations. Mapping to CCDA is one of many options, not the only one.</p>
