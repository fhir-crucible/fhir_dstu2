<h2>Conformance Packages defined as part of FHIR</h2>

This specification is a common platform standard that must be <a href="profiling.html">adapted to particular
use cases</a>. 

Some particular use cases are common or important enough to be described as a part of the 
specification itself.
These are published a "Conformance Package" - a group of <a href="profile.html">Profiles</a>, <a href="extensiondefinition.html">Extension Definitions</a>,
<a href="valueset.html">Value Sets</a>, and examples that are all defined with a common purpose.
