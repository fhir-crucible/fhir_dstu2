<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

    <p>
        A <i>Procedure Request</i> is a record of a request for a procedure to be performed. 
        It can be used to represent a procedure that is planned, that is proposed, or that is ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
        The procedure request may represent an order that is entered by a practitioner in a CPOE 
        system as well as a proposal made by a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based 
        on a patient's clinical record and context of care. Planned procedures may also be 
        represented by this resource (though this use case is still being discussed and will 
        need to be validated by Patient Care and Orders and Observation).

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
    <b>Notes to reviewers:</b>

    <p>
        <i>Please note that the boundaries between a Diagnostic Order and a Procedure Request will need to be concretely
        defined by Patient Care.</i>
    </p>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
