  Element = Provenance

  UML = 0;0
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Label = Who, What, When for a set of resources
  Definition = Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g., Document Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact Security, Privacy, and Trust policies.
  Comments = Some parties may be duplicated between the target resource and its provenance.  For instance, the prescriber is usually (but not always) the author of the prescription resource. This resource is defined with close consideration for W3C Provenance

  Definition = The Reference(s) that were generated or updated by  the activity described in this resource. A provenance can point to more than one target if multiple resources were created/updated by the same activity
  Comments = Target references are usually version specific, but may not be, if a version has not been assigned or if the provenance information is part of the set of resources being maintained (i.e. a document). When using the RESTful API, the identity of the resource may not be known (especially not the version specific one); the client may either submit the resource first, and then the provenance, or it may submit both using a single transaction. See the notes on transaction for further discussion
