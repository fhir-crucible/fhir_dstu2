<h2>Profiling FHIR</h2>

<p>
The base FHIR specification (this specification) describes a set of base resources, frameworks
and APIs that are used in many different contexts in healthcare. However there is wide variability
between jurisdictions and across the healthcare eco-system around
practices, requirements, regulations, education and what actions are feasible
and/or beneficial.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, the FHIR specification is a "platform specification" - it creates
a common platform or foundation on which a variety of different solutions are implemented.
As a consequence, this specification usually requires further adaptation to particular
contexts of use. Typically, these adaptations specify:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Rules about which resource elements are or are not used, and what additional elements are added that are not part of the base specification</li>
 <li>Rules about which API features are used, and how</li>
 <li>Rules about which terminologies and used in particular elements</li>
 <li>Descriptions of how the Resource elements and API features map to local requirements and/or implementations</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that because of the nature of the healthcare eco-system, there may be multiple
overlapping sets of adaptations - by healthcare domain, by country, by institution, and/or by vendor/implementation.
</p>
<p>
Typically, adaptations (either actual implementations or specifications - often called "Implementation Guides")
both restrict and extend APIs, resources and terminologies. FHIR provides a set of resources that
can be used to represent and share the decisions that have been made, and allows implementers to build useful services from them. These
resources are known as the conformance resources. These conformance resources allow implementers to:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Indicate that <a href="http.html">some API calls</a> are not used for a particular use , and provide additional details about how the API calls are used (<a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a> Resource)</li>
 <li>Add additional <a href="operations.html">operations</a> or <a href="search.html">search parameters</a> not in the base specification
   (using the <a href="operationdefinition.html">OperationDefinition</a> resource or the <a href="searchparameter.html">SearchParameter</a> Resource</li>
 <li>Define how a particular structure (Resource, Extension or Data Type) is used (<a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a> Resource):
    <ul>
      <li>Describe how existing elements in resources are used</li>
      <li>Identify existing elements that are not used</li>
      <li>Define extensions that can be used in resources or data types</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Mix custom and standard terminologies and choose which codes from these to use for a particular use (<a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a> and StructureDefinition Resources)</li>
 <li>Map between local and standard terminologies or content models (<a href="conceptmap.html">Concept Map</a> Resource)</li>
 <li>Register system namespaces for identifiers and terminologies (<a href="namingsystem.html">NamingSystem</a> Resource)</li>
 <li>Describe and register specific Data Elements that are used across systems in a Data Dictionary (<a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> Resource)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These resources need to be used as discussed below, and also
following the basic concepts for extension that are described in <a href="extensibility.html">"Extensibility"</a>.
For implementer convenience, the specification itself publishes its base definitions using these same resources.
</p>

<h3>Two uses of Profiles</h3>
<p>
The <a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a> resource describes two different uses for profiles on resources:
Resource Profiles and System Profiles. Resource Profiles are specified using <i>Conformance.rest.resource.profile</i> element 
and System Profiles are specified using <i>Conformance.profile</i> element. 
</p>
<h4>Resource Profiles</h4>
<p>
These profiles describe the general features that are supported by the system for each kind of 
resource. Typically, this is the superset of all the different use-cases implemented by the system. 
This is a resource-level perspective of the system functionality. 
</p>
<h4>System Profiles</h4>
<p>
These profiles describe the information handled/produced by the system on a per use case basis.
Some examples of the uses for system profiles:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A Laboratory service producing a set of different reports - general chemistry, blood count, etc. Typical labs would support several hundred different reports</li>
 <li>A care manager which handles a set of different types of care plans and associated clinical resources</li>
 <li>A medications formulary that handles several different levels of sophistication in its medication representations</li>
</ul> 
<p>
Typically, these profiles are a series of variations on the same set of resources - different use cases leading to handling 
the resources that represent them differently. These use-cases described above all pertain to system that produce and publish
data, but the same concept applies to systems that consume data. For instance:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>An expert service that provides analysis on several different sets of data conforming to a particular pattern - tests x,y and z with particular codes and units</li>
</ul>
<p>
For producer and a consumer systems to exchange data successfully based on 
one of these system supported profiles, it's not enough to know that the
systems happen to have system profiles that overlap for the use case 
of interest; the consumer must be able to filter the total set of resources
made available by the producer system and deal only with the ones relevant
to the use case. 
</p>
<p>
As an example consider a laboratory system generating 1000s of reports 
a day. 1% of those reports are a particular endocrine report that a 
decision support system knows how to process. Both systems declare that 
they support the particular endocrine profile, but how does the expert
system actually find the endocrine reports that it knows how to process? 
</p>
<p>
One possible option is for the expert system to receive every single 
report coming from the lab system, check whether it conforms to the 
profile or not, and then decide whether to process it. Checking whether
a resource conforms to a particular profile or not is a straight 
forward operation (on option is to use the <a href="downloads.html">provided tools for this</a>),
but this is very inefficient way - the expert system has to receive 
and process 100 times many resources as it uses. To help a consumer 
find the correct set of reports for a use-case, the producer of the 
resources also SHALL:
</p>
<ol>
 <li><a href="resource.html#meta">Mark resources</a> with profile assertions documenting the profile(s) they conform to (this enables indexing by the profile)</li>
 <li>(if a server) support searching by the <a href="search.html#profile">_profile parameter</a> for the declared profiles</li>
</ol>
<p>
Beyond these requirements, a producer of resources SHOULD ensure that any data that would reasonably be expected
to conform to the declared profiles SHOULD be published in this form. 
</p>

<a name="dstu"> </a>
<blockquote>
<p>
DSTU note: there are many uninvestigated issues associated with system profiles. 
HL7 is actively seeking feedback from users who experiment with system profiles, and users
should be prepared for changes to features and obligations in this area in the future.
</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="api"> </a>
<h3>Extending and Restricting the API</h3>
<p>
A conformance resource lists the REST interactions (read, update, search, etc) that a server provides or that a client uses, along with 
some supporting information for each. It can also be used to define a set of desired behavior (e.g. as part of a specification or
a Request for Proposal).  The only interaction that servers are required to support is the <a href="http.html#conformance">Conformance</a>
interaction itself - to retrieve the server's conformance statement. Beyond that, servers and clients support and use whichever
API calls are relevant to their use case.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the operations that FHIR provides, servers may provide additional 
operations that are not part of the FHIR specification. Implementers can safely do this 
by appending a custom operation name prefixed with '$' to an existing FHIR URL, as the <a href="operations.html">Operations
framework</a> does. The Conformance resource supports defining what OperationDefinitions make use of particular
names on an end point.  If services are defined that are not declared using OperationDefinition, it may be
appropriate to use longer names, reducing the chance of collision (and confusion) with services declared by
other interfaces.  The base specification will never define operation names with a "." in them, so 
implementers are recommended to use some appropriate prefix for their names (such as "ihe.someService")
to reduce the likelihood of name conflicts. 
</p>
<p>
Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to define operations using the standard
FHIR operations framework - that is, to declare the operations using the OperationDefinition
resource, but some operations may involve formats that can't be described that way. 
</p>
<p>
Implementations are also able to extend the FHIR API using additional content types. 
For instance, it might be useful to <a href="http.html#read">read</a> or <a href="http.html#update">update</a> 
the appointment resources using a vCard based format. vCard defines its own mime type, and these additional mime types can 
safely be used in addition to those defined in this specification.
</p>

<a name="resources"> </a>
<h3>Extending and Restricting Resources</h3>

<p>
Extending and restricting resources (collectively known as 'constraining a resource') is done with a 
"StructureDefinition" resource, which is a statement of rules about
how the elements in a resource are used, and where extensions are used in a resource.
</p>

<h3>Limitations of Use</h3>
<p>
What Structure Definitions can do when they are constraining existing resources and datatypes is limited in some respects:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Profiles cannot break the rules established in the base specification (e.g. if the element cardinality is 1..1 in the base specification, a profile cannot say it is 0..1, or 1..*)</li>
 <li>Profiles cannot specify default values or meanings for elements</li>
 <li>Profiles cannot give more specific names to elements</li>
 <li>It must be safe to process a resource without knowing the profile</li>
</ul>
<p>
The consequence of this is that if a profile mandates extended behavior that cannot
be ignored, it must also mandate the use of a <a href="extensibility.html#modifiers">modifier extension</a>. 
Another way of saying this is that knowledge must be explicit in
the instance, not implicit in the profile. 
</p>
<p>
As an example, if a profile wished to describe that a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>
resource was being negated (e.g. asserting that it never happened), it could not simply say 
in the profile itself that this is what the resource means; instead, the profile must 
say that the resource must have an extension that represents this knowledge. 
</p>
<p>
There is the facility to mark resources that they can only be safely understood by 
a process that is aware of and understands a set of published rules. For more information,
see <a href="resource.html#ruleset">Restricted Understanding of Resources</a>.
</p>


<h3>Using Structure Definitions</h3>
<p>
A "constraint" Structure Definition specifies a set of restrictions on the content of a FHIR resource or data type.
A given structure definition is identified by its canonical URL, which SHOULD be the URL at which it
is published. The following kinds of statements can be made about how an element is used:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Restricting the cardinality of the element. e.g. the base might allow 0..*, and a particular application might support 1..2</li>
 <li>Ruling out use of an element by setting its maximum cardinality to 0</li>
 <li>Restricting the contents of an element to a single fixed value</li>
 <li>Making additional invariants on the content of nested elements within the resource (expressed as XPath statements)</li>
 <li>Restricting the types for an element that allows multiple types</li>
 <li>Requiring a typed element or the target of a resource reference to conform to another structure profile (declared in the same profile, or elsewhere)</li>
 <li>Specifying a binding to a different terminology value set (see below)</li>
 <li>Providing alternative definitions and examples for the elements defined in a Resource to explain how they are used in the context of the Profile</li>
 <li>Providing more specific or additional mappings (e.g. to v2 or v3) for the resource when used in a particular context</li>
 <li>Declaring that one or more elements in the structure must be 'supported' (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>
All of these changed definitions SHALL be restrictions that are consistent with the
rules defined in the base resource in the FHIR Specification. Note that some of 
these restrictions can be enforced by tooling (and are by the FHIR tooling), but 
others (e.g. alignment of changes to descriptive text) cannot be automatically enforced.
</p>
<p>
A structure definition contains a linear list of element declarations. The inherent
nested structure of the elements is derived from the <i>path</i> value of each element.
For instance, a sequence of the element paths like this:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Root</li>
 <li>Root.childA</li>
 <li>Root.childA.grandchild1</li>
 <li>Root.childB</li>
</ul>
<p>
defines the following structure:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;Root&gt;
   &lt;childA&gt;
     &lt;grandChild/&gt;
   &lt;/childA&gt;
   &lt;childB/&gt;
 &lt;/Root&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or its JSON equivalent. The structure is coherent - children are never
implied, and the path statements are always in order. The element list is
a linear list rather than being explicitly nested because element definitions
are frequently re-used in multiple places within a single definition, and this re-use
is easier with a flat structure.
</p>

<a name="snapshot"> </a>
<h3>Differential vs Snapshot</h3>

<p>
Structure Definitions may contain either a differential statement, a snapshot
statement or both.
</p>
<p>Differential statements describe only the differences that they make
relative to another structure definition (which is most often the base FHIR resource or data type).
For example, a profile may make a single element mandatory (cardinality 1..1).
In the case of a differential structure, it will contain a single element
with the path of the element being made mandatory, and a cardinality statement.
Nothing else is stated - all the rest of the structural information is implied (note:
this implies that a differential profile can be sparse, and only
mention the elements that are changed, without having to list the
full structure).
</p>
<p>
In order to properly understand a differential structure, it must be
applied to the structure definition on which it is based. In order to save
tools from needing to support this operation (which is computationally intensive - and
impossible if the base structure is not available), a StructureDefinition
can also carry a "snapshot" - a fully calculated form of the
structure that is not dependent on any other structure. The FHIR
project provides tools for the common platforms that can populate
a snapshot from a differential.
</p>
<p>
StructureDefinitions can contain both a differential and a snapshot view.
In fact, this is the most useful form - the differential
form serves the authoring process, while the snapshot serves
the implementation tooling. StructureDefinition resources used in operational
systems should always have the snapshot view populated.
</p>

<a name="slicing"> </a>
<h3>Slicing</h3>
<p>
One common feature of constraining Structure Definitions is to take an element that may occur more than once (e.g. in a list), <!-- What about slicing type choices? -->
and split the list into a series of sublists, each with different restrictions on the elements in the sublist with associated
additional meaning. In FHIR, this operation is known as "Slicing" a list. It is common to
“slice” a list into sub-lists containing just one element, effectively putting constraints on each element in the list.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example to illustrate the process:
</p>
<img alt="Slicing diagram" src="slicing.png" width="461" height="353"/>
<p>
In this example, the base structure definition for the resource defines 
the "related" element which refers to
another Observation which is related to the main Observation and which may occur
multiple times. Each "related" element has a "type" element specifying the nature
of the relationship (component, replacement, derivation etc.), and a "target" element
which identifies the actual observation. In this diagram, for convenience, the contents
of the target element are shown in the inner box instead of the showing the target
reference explicitly. Also, to avoid adding clutter in this simplified example,
the "name" attribute of Observation is shown as just a code not a full CodeableConcept.
</p>
<p>
The structure definition for Blood Pressure splits the related element list into
2 sublists of one element each: a systolic element, and a diastolic element. Each of these
elements has a fixed value for the type element, and the structure definition also fixes the
contents of the target observation as well, specifying a fixed LOINC code for
the name and specifying that both have a value of type Quantity. This process
is known as "slicing" and the Systolic and Diastolic elements are called "slices".
</p>

<p>
Note that when the resource is exchanged, the wire format that is exchanged is not
altered by the constraining definition. This means that the item profile names defined in the
structure definition ("systolic", etc. in this example) are never exchanged. A resource
instance looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;Observation&gt;
   ...
   &lt;related&gt;
     &lt;type value=&quot;component&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;target ...&gt; &lt;!-- has the name "8480-6" -->
   &lt;/related&gt;
   &lt;related&gt;
     &lt;type value=&quot;component&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;target ...&gt;  &lt;!-- has the name "8462-4" -->
   &lt;/related&gt;
 &lt;/Observation&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In order to determine that the first related item corresponds to "Systolic" in
the structure definition, so that it can determine which additional constraints for a sub-list the item conforms,
the system checks the values of the elements. In this case, the "name" element
in the target resource can be used to determine which slice that target refers to. 
This element is called the “discriminator”.
</p>

<a name="discriminator"> </a>
<h3>Discriminator</h3>
<p>
In the general case, systems processing resources using a structure definition
that slices a list can determine which slice an item in
the list by checking whether its content meets the rules specified
for the slice.
</p>
<p>
This requires for a processor to be able to check all the rules
applied in the slice and to do so speculatively in a depth-first
fashion. Neither of these is appropriate for an operational system,
and particularly not for generated code. For this reason, a slice 
can nominate a set of fields that act as a "discriminator" - they
are used to tell the slices apart. 
</p>
<p>
When a discriminator is provided, the composite of the values of 
the elements nominated in the discriminator is unique and distinct
for each possible slice and applications can easily determine
which slice an item in a list corresponds to. The intention is that 
this can be done in generated code.
</p>
<p>
When a constraining structure nominates one or more discriminators, it SHALL
fix the value of the element for each discriminator for each
slice, or if the element has a terminology binding, it SHALL be
associated with a complete binding with a closed <a href="valueset.html#closed">Value Set</a>
reference that enumerates the possible codes in the value set.
The structure definition SHALL ensure that there is no overlap between the
set of values and/or codes in the value sets between slices.
</p>
<p>
It is the composite (combined) values of the discriminators 
that are unique, not each discriminator alone. For example,
a slice on a list of items that are references to other 
resources could nominate fields from different resources, 
where each resource only has one of the nominated elements,
as long as they are distinct across slices.
</p>
<p>
A structure definition is not required to nominate any discriminator at all
for a slice, but those that don't identify discriminators are describing
content that is very difficult to process, and so this is
discouraged.
</p>
<p>
Within a structure definition, a slice is defined using multiple <i>element</i>
entries that share a <i>path</i> but have distinct <i>name</i>s.
These entries together form a "slice group" that is:
</p>
<ol>
       
	<li><b>Initiated by a "slicing entry"</b> That is, the first
		<i>element</i> in a slice group must contain a
		<i>slicing</i> property that defines the
		<i>discriminator</i> for all members of the group.  It also contains the unconstrained definition of the element that is sliced</li>

	<li><b>Mutually exclusive</b>. This means that each
		<i>element</i> in a slice group SHALL describe a
		distinct set of  values for the group's
		<i>discriminators</i>.  Because of this constraint, an 
	        element in a resource <b>instance</b> will never match more
		than one <i>element</i> in a given slice group. If no discriminators are named, 
    it SHOULD still be possible to differentiate the slices based 
    on their properties, though it may be substantially harder to 
    do so</li>

	<li><b>Serialized as a group</b>. The entries in a slice
		group must be <b>adjacent</b> in a serialized structure definition,
		<b>or</b>, if there are any intervening elements, those
		elements must be "compatible with" the group. Concretely, this
		means that any intervening elements must have a
		<i>path</i> that starts with the slice groups's
		<i>path</i>.  For example, an <i>element</i> with a
		<i>path</i> of <i>Observation.name.extension</i>
		would be compatible with (and thus, would not "break up") a
		slice group whose path was <i>Observation.name</i> </li>
</ol>
<p>
The value of the discriminator element is a path name that identifies
the descendant element using a dotted notation. For references, the path
transitions smoothly across the reference and into the children of the 
root element/object of the resource. For extensions, an extension can be
qualified with the URL of the extensions being referred to.
There are two special names: @type, and @profile. Here are some example discriminators:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>  <td><b>Context</b></td> <td><b>Discriminator</b></td> <td><b>Interpretation</b></td> </tr>
 <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.name</td> <td>Entries are differentiated by the name element on the target resource - probably an observation, which could be determined by other information in the profile</td> </tr>
 <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.@type</td> <td>Entries are differentiated by the type of the target element that the reference points to</td> </tr>
 <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.@profile</td> <td>Entries are differentiated by a profile tag on the target of the reference, as specified by a structure definition (todo: how to do that?)</td> </tr>
 <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.extension["http://acme.org/extensions/test"].code</td> <td>Entries are differentiated by the value of the code element in the extension with the nominated URL</td> </tr>
 <tr>  <td>List.entry.extension</td> <td>url</td> <td>Extensions are differentiated by the value of their url property (usually how extensions are sliced)</td> </tr>
 <tr>  <td>List.entry</td> <td>item.reference.@type, item.reference.name</td> <td>Extensions are differentiated by the combination of item.reference.name, and, if it has one, the name element. This would be
   appropriate for where a List might be composed of a Condition, and set of observations, each differentiated by its name - the condition has no name, so that is evaluated as a null in the discriminator set</td> </tr>
</table>

<a name="extensions"> </a>
<h3>Extension Definitions</h3>
<p>
An extension definition defines the url that identifies the extension
and which is used to refers to the extension definition when it is used 
in a resource.
</p>
<p>
The extension definition also defines the context where the extension can be used (usually
a particular path or a data type) and then defines the extension element using the same details used to 
profile the structural elements that are part of resources. This means that a single extension 
can be defined once and used on different Resource and/or datatypes, e.g. one would only have to 
define an extension for “hair color” once, and then specify it can be used on both Patient and Practitioner.
</p>
<p>
For further discussion of defining and using extensions, along with some examples, 
see <a href="extensibility.html">Extensibility</a>. 
</p>

<h4>Using Extensions in Profiles</h4>
<p>
Once defined, an extension can be used in an instance of a resource 
without any Profile declaring that it can, should or must be, but 
Profiles can be used to describe how an extension is used.
</p>
<p>
To actually prescribe the use of an extension in an instance, the extension list 
on the resource needs to be sliced. This is shown in <a href="extensibility-examples.html#sliceextensions">the extensibility 
examples</a></p>
<p>
Note that the minimum cardinality of an extension SHALL be a valid restriction
on the minimum cardinality in the definition of the extension. if the minimum
cardinality of the extension is 1 when it is defined, it can only be mandatory
when it is added to a profile. This is not recommended - the minimum cardinality
of an extension should usually be 0. 
</p>


<a name="binding"> </a>
<h3>Binding Definitions</h3>

<p>
Coded elements have bindings that link from the element to a definition of the 
set of possible codes the element may contain. The binding identifies the 
definition of the set of possible codes and controls how tightly the set of the possible codes is interpreted.
</p>
<p>
The set of possible codes is either a formal reference to a <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> 
resource, which may be version specific, or a general reference to some web content that defines a set of 
codes. The second is most appropriate where set of values is defined by 
some external standard (such as mime types). Alternatively, where the binding
is incomplete (e.g. under development) just a text description of the 
possible codes can be provided. 
</p>
<p> 
Bindings have a property that define how the strongly implementations are required to use the 
set of codes. See <a href="terminologies.html#strength">Binding Strength</a>.
</p>

<a name="tx"> </a>
<h3>Mixing Custom and Standard Terminologies</h3>
<p>
<a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a> resources can be used to define local codes (Example) and 
to mix a combination of local codes and standard codes (examples: LOINC, SNOMED), or just
to choose a particular set of standard codes (examples: LOINC, SNOMED, RxNorm). 
Profiles can bind to these value sets instead of the ones defined in the base
specification, following these rules:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr> <td><b>Binding Type in base specification</b></td> <td><b>Matching Profile Properties</b></td> <td><b>Customization Rules in Profiles</b></td> </tr>

 <tr> <td>Complete</td> <td>conformance = required, extensible = false</td> <td>The value set can only contain codes contained in the value set specified by the FHIR specification</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Incomplete</td> <td>conformance = preferred and extensible = true</td> <td>The value set can contain codes not found in the base value set. These additional codes SHOULD not have the same meaning as existing codes in the base value set</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Example</td> <td>conformance = example</td> <td>The value set can contain whatever is appropriate for local use</td> </tr> 
</table> 

<a name="mustSupport"> </a>
<h3>Must Support</h3>
<p>
One property that can be declared on profiles that is not declared on the resource or data type definitions is "Must Support".
This is a boolean property.  If true, it means that systems claiming to conform to a given profile must "support" the element.
This is distinct from cardinality.  It is possible to have an element with a minimum cardinality of "0", but still expect systems
to support the element.
</p>
<p>
The meaning of "support" is left deliberately ambiguous.  Examples might include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The system must be able to store and retrieve the element</li>
  <li>The system must display the element to the user and/or allow the user to capture the element via the UI</li>
  <li>The element must appear in an output report</li>
  <li>The element must be taken into account when performing decision support, calculations or other processing</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The specific meaning of "Must Support" for the purposes of a particular profile SHALL be described in the Profile.description or in other documentation for the
implementation guide the profile is part of.
</p>
<p>
If creating a profile based on another profile, Must Support can be changed from false to true, but cannot be changed from true to false.
</p>

<a name="search"> </a>
<h3>Search Criteria</h3>
<p>
The final thing implementations can do is to define search criteria in addition to those defined in the specification itself.  
Search criteria fall into one of four categories:
</p>
