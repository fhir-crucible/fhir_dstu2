<h2>Example Usage Scenarios</h2>

<p>
The following are example usage scenarios for the DiagnosticReport profile:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Query for diagnostic reports belonging to a Patient</li>
	<li>Query for all patients who have had a specific diagnostic test report</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Implementation Guidance</h2>

<p>
Implementers need to be mindful of the following during their implementation
</p>
<ul>
	
	<p><b>Specifying Patients as part of the DiagnosticReport Queries:</b> DAFDiagnosticReport profile supports the querying the DiagnosticReport for a particular patient. In order to achieve this in implementation, it is recommended to use Patient.identifier field to precisely identify the allergies relevant to the patient. While other parameters such as  Patient.name, Patient.given could be used for the query, it could lead to incorrect Patient matching and/or inefficient queries when systems are not tuned. </p>
	
	<p><b>Patient Matching:</b> Patient Matching rules and criteria have to be evaluated by the implementing organization and have to comply with local policies and regulations. Query Requestors will have to deal with result sets that can return zero,one or more DiagnosticReport Resources in response to a query.</p>
	
	
</ul>
