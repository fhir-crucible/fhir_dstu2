 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Annotation
  Type = Type
  Short Label = Text node with attribution
  Definition = A  text note which also  contains information about who made the statement and when
  Comments = For systems that do not have structured annotations, they can simply communicate a single annotation with no author or time. \nThis element may need to be included in narrative because of the potential for modifying information. \n*Annotations SHOULD NOT* be used to communicate \"modifying\" information that could be computable. (This is a SHOULD because enforcing user behavior is nearly impossible)
