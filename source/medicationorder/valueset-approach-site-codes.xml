      <p>The value set to instantiate this attribute should be drawn from a terminologically robust code system that consists of or contains site of administration concepts.</p>

        <li>SNOMED CT - selected children of SCTID:91723000 &quot;anatomical structure&quot; (note: there would need to be considerable selection 
          of concepts as the full child subset would be too big and too detailed for use)</li>
        
        
        <li>ISO 11239 - Intended site</li>
        
        
        <li>NCIt - selected children of NCIt concept C74444456 &quot;anatomical location&quot; (note: this is the SDTM location concepts; 
          it would also need subsetting to provide a useable set of medication administration)
          Note: to avoid confusion with other attributes in this resource concepts that are pre-coordinated with method and/or 
          route of administration (e.g.  &quot;rub into left hand&quot; where &quot;rub in&quot; is the method or &quot;IV into left subclavian vein&quot; where &quot;IV&quot; is the route) should not be used in this value set</li>

      <p>SNOMED CT is being used here as the example terminology.</p>
