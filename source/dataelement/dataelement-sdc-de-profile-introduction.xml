<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This profile is a placeholder and is not complete.  It will eventually set expectations for the capability of data element registry systems as well as systems that create and curate
data elements.  It expands on the expectations of the <a href="dataelement-sdc.html">base SDC DataElement</a> profile by adding DataElement properties relevant for
maintenance of data elements, rather than merely what is sufficient to allow a data element to be referenced within a form.  Guidance found within that profile
also applies to this one.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of this profile, <i>Supported</i> means that clients SHALL be capable of processing the element/extension and use the information to control the display
and information capture associated with the <a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a>.  It means that servers SHALL be capable of persisting those elements and returning them in response
to requests.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This profile relies on the use of a number of other profiles, some required, others available for use "when necessary":
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="dataelement-11179.html">datalement-11179</a> which defines extensions for ISO-11179-specific concepts, such as ObjectClass and Property</li>
  <li><a href="element-extensions.html">element-extensions</a> which defines extensions describing constraints on the values for data elements.  There are used here to constrain the allowed values for questions.</li>
  <li><a href="iso-21090.html">iso-21090</a> provides extensions for strings allowing the conveying of language and translation extensions which may be relevant in some environment</li>
</ul>
