
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = Attachment
  English = It the Attachment has data, it SHALL have a contentType
  XPath = not(exists(f:data)) or exists(f:contentType)

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment
  Type = Type
  Short Label = Content in a format defined elsewhere
  Definition = For referring to data content defined in other formats.
  Requirements = Many models need to include data defined in other specifications that is complex and opaque to the healthcare model. This includes documents, media recordings, structured data, etc.
  Comments = When providing a summary view (for example with Observation.value[x]) Attachment should be represented with a brief display text such as \"Attachment\".
  v2 Mapping = ED/RP
  RIM Mapping = ED

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.contentType
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = code
  Binding = MimeType
  Short Label = Mime type of the content, with charset etc.
  Definition = Identifies the type of the data in the attachment and allows a method to be chosen to interpret or render the data. Includes mime type parameters such as charset where appropriate
  Requirements = Processors of the data need to be able to know how to interpret the data
  v2 Mapping = ED.2+ED.3/RP.2+RP.3. Note conversion may be needed if old style values are being used
  RIM Mapping = ./mediaType, ./charset
  Example = text/plain; charset=UTF-8, image/png

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.language
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = code
  Binding = Language
  Short Label = Human language of the content (BCP-47)
  Definition = The human language of the content. The value can be any valid value according to BCP 47
  Requirements = Users need to be able to choose between the languages in a set of attachments
  RIM Mapping = ./language
  Example = en-AU

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.data
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = base64Binary
  Short Label = Data inline, base64ed
  Definition = The actual data of the attachment - a sequence of bytes. In XML, represented using base64
  Requirements = The data needs to able to be transmitted inline
  Comments = The base64-encoded data SHALL be expressed in the same character set as the base resource XML or JSON
  v2 Mapping = ED.5
  RIM Mapping = ./data

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.url
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = uri
  Short Label = Uri where the data can be found
  Definition = An alternative location where the data can be accessed
  Requirements = The data needs to be transmitted by reference
  Comments = If both data and url are provided, the url SHALL point to the same content as the data contains. Urls may be relative references or may reference transient locations such as a wrapping envelope using cid: though this has ramifications for using signatures. Relative URLs are interpreted relative to the service url, like a resource reference, rather than relative to the resource itself. If a URL is provided, it SHALL resolve to actual data.
  v2 Mapping = RP.1+RP.2 - if they refer to a URL (see v2.6)
  RIM Mapping = ./reference/literal
  Example = http://www.acme.com/logo-small.png

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.size
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = unsignedInt
  Short Label = Number of bytes of content (if url provided)
  Definition = The number of bytes of data that make up this attachment.
  Requirements = Representing the size allows applications to determine whether they should fetch the content automatically in advance, or refuse to fetch it at all
  Comments = The number of bytes is redundant if the data is provided as a base64binary, but is useful if the data is provided as a url reference
  RIM Mapping = N/A (needs data type R3 proposal)

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.hash
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = base64Binary
  Short Label = Hash of the data (sha-1, base64ed )
  Definition = The calculated hash of the data using SHA-1. Represented using base64
  Requirements = Included so that applications can verify that the contents of a location have not changed and so that a signature of the content can implicitly sign the content of an image without having to include the data in the instance or reference the url in the signature
  RIM Mapping = .integrityCheck[parent::ED/integrityCheckAlgorithm=\"SHA-1\"]

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = !Attachment.lang
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = code
  Binding = Language
  Short Label = ISO 639-3 language code
  Definition = The language that the attachment is in
  Requirements = May need to be able to pick the right language to render for a particular person from a list of attachments in different languages
  Comments = note that the v3 lang is ISO 639-2 and this is ISO 639-3
  RIM Mapping = ./language
  Example = eng (English), esp (Spanish)

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.title
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = Label to display in place of the data
  Definition = A label or set of text to display in place of the data
  Requirements = Applications need a label to display to a human user in place of the actual data if the data cannot be rendered or perceived by the viewer.
  RIM Mapping = ./title/data
  Example = \"Official Corporate Logo\"

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = Attachment.creation
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Label = Date attachment was first created
  Definition = The date that the attachment was first created
  Requirements = This is often tracked as an integrity issue for use of the attachment
  RIM Mapping = N/A (needs data type R3 proposal)
