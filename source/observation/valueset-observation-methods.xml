      <p>This value sets refers to 3 different sources of observation method codes, each with issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>v3 Code System "ObservationMethod": this is very incomplete and not currently maintained</li>      
        <li>SNOMED CT Techniques (descendents of 272394005): this is very incomplete, more than just observation methods, and has SNOMED CT licensing issues</li>      
        <li>LOINC Method List: this is less incomplete, but not designed to be used as a formal code system</li>      
      </ul>
