			<definition value=" The results of observations generated by laboratories.  Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory."/>

			<definition value="  Observations generated by other procedures.  This category includes observations resulting from interventional and non-interventional procedures excluding lab and imaging (e.g. cardiology catheterization, endoscopy, electrodiagnostics, etc).  Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about component observations made during a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy."/>
